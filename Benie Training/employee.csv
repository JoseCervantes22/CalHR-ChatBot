COBRA,"Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives workers and their families who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health benefits provided by their group health plan for limited periods of time under certain circumstances such as voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce, and other life events. Qualified beneficiaries may be required to pay the entire premium for coverage up to 102 percent of the cost of the plan.

The COBRA statute requires employers to offer continuation of group coverage including health, dental, vision, and FlexElect Medical Reimbursement Accounts to covered employees, spouses, domestic partners*, and eligible dependent children who lose group coverage due to a qualifying event. These individuals are known as qualified beneficiaries. The terms and timeframes are set by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service.

As a state employee enrolled in state-sponsored benefits, you should be aware of your COBRA rights in the event that you lose coverage due to a qualifying event. You also have the responsibility to report certain life events to your departmental personnel office to ensure you and your qualified dependents maintain COBRA eligibility.

* The state considers a covered domestic partner as a qualified beneficiary who may continue group coverage under COBRA.

Initial General COBRA Notice
Your departmental personnel office will provide the initial general COBRA notice to individuals covered under state-sponsored plans describing your COBRA rights. Your departmental personnel office must provide this notice to covered individuals within the first 90 days of coverage. The notice contains the information that you need to know to protect your COBRA rights while you are covered under the plans. This includes the name of the plan, a general description of the COBRA coverage provided under the plan, departmental personnel office contact information, and an explanation of any notices you must give your departmental personnel office to protect your COBRA rights.

For more information on the program and eligibility, please contact your departmental personnel office.

Cash Option – Non-CoBen,"Cash Option – Non-CoBen
If you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, parent, or another source, you have the option to receive cash in lieu of your state-sponsored health and/or dental benefits. Qualifying group health coverage includes health coverage that provides minimum value as established by the federal Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is maintained by an employer or employee organization. All state CalPERS health plans currently meet the law’s minimum value standards.

The ACA establishes a minimum value standard of benefits of a health plan. For a qualifying group health plan to meet the ACA’s minimum value standards, the plan must cover at least 60 percent of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan. Employees may refer to their plan’s Summary of Benefits and Coverage document to determine if their coverage meets the law’s minimum value standards.

Employees enrolled in individual coverage, such as TRICARE, Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Covered California, are not eligible to receive cash in lieu of other health coverage, even if the coverage provides minimum value.

Benefits of the Cash Option
Cash option benefits are provided under the FlexElect program. Depending on which cash option you enroll in, you’ll receive the following:

$128/month in lieu of health benefits;
$12/month in lieu of dental benefits; or
$140/month in lieu of health and dental benefits.
This money is treated as taxable income and is reported on your W-2 statement for the tax year when you receive payment. Cash option payments are not considered compensation for retirement purposes.

This plan applies to employees in Bargaining Units 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, and 21. Excluded employees and employees in Bargaining Units 2, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, and 19: You’re covered by Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) and your cash option is available through CoBen, not FlexElect. 

Contact your department’s personnel office for information and forms to enroll in a CoBen Cash Option.  

SEIU Local 1000 represented employees and excluded classes tied to SEIU are not eligible to participate in the FlexElect or CoBen Cash Options until July 1, 2022, due to receiving other negotiated benefits.

Please contact your department’s personnel office to learn more about eligibility.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/general-benefits/cash-option-non-coben/,General Benefits
FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts,"FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The FlexElect Program allows state employees to set aside money in a reimbursement account to pay for certain kinds of expenses. Deductions occur before tax withholding, reducing your tax liability.

Medical Reimbursement Accounts – Set aside money for eligible medical expenses.
Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts – Set aside money to to pay for childcare expenses and the care of qualifying adults who cannot care for themselves. ​
When you enroll in a reimbursement account, you designate an amount to be deducted each month from your wages. That money is automatically deposited in your account for one plan year. After incurring health-related or dependent care expenses during that year, you submit a claim for reimbursement from your account. Your reimbursement check is mailed to you, or you can request direct deposit into your checking or savings account.

Please read the 2022 FlexElect Handbook carefully before making a decision about enrolling in the program. This program offers several choices, and you will need to determine which options are right for you. Contact your department’s personnel office if you have any questions that are not answered on this page or in the plan handbook. You may also wish to seek the advice of a qualified tax consultant.

Who Can Enroll
You are eligible to enroll in a reimbursement account if you have a permanent position that is half-time or more. If you have a limited-term or temporary position, you’re eligible if you have a mandatory right of return to a permanent position that is half-time or more. If you’re a permanent-intermittent employee, you’re not eligible to enroll in a reimbursement account.

Enrollment
You may enroll in a reimbursement account during the annual Open Enrollment period or within 60 days of experiencing an event that makes you newly eligible for these benefits.

 

Newly Eligible
Events that make you newly eligible for these benefits include the following:

You are a new state employee hired after the Open Enrollment period.
You were on an approved leave of absence during the entire Open Enrollment period.
You experience a change in status that permits you to enroll as newly eligible. If your change in status results in a concurrent approved leave of absence (e.g., birth of child followed by a maternity leave), you may enroll by the deadlines specified below after you return to work.
Your time base or employee designation changes from one that was ineligible to one that is eligible or you change from a permanent-intermittent position to a permanent position with a time base of half-time or more.​
 

Deadline for newly eligible employees to enroll:
If you are newly eligible and want to enroll in a reimbursement account, you must submit enrollment forms to your department’s personnel office within 60 days after becoming newly eligible. If you complete your forms correctly and the State Controller’s Office (SCO) receives them by the tenth of the month, your enrollment is effective the first of the following month. When the tenth is on a weekend or holiday, the cut-off date will be on the next regular workday. Forms received after the tenth of the month will be the effective the first of the next following month. Be sure to review your election carefully before you submit your form.

For 2022: If you are newly eligible, your last possible effective date of participation in the 2022 plan year is December 1, 2022. For your enrollment to be effective December 1, 2022, SCO must receive your enrollment form by November 10, 2022. Forms received after that date will be processed for the 2023 plan year.

Making Changes
​You can’t change or cancel your enrollment during the plan year unless there is a change in your status, called a permitting event. A list of permitting events is available for medical reimbursement accounts and dependent care reimbursement accounts.

If you increase your deduction amount because of a permitting event during the plan year, you may only claim the increased amount for expenses incurred from the effective date of your change and not the permitting event date.

​Administrative Fee
If you enroll in a reimbursement account, a $1.00 fee is deducted from your after-tax salary each month. This fee covers the administrative costs for the program.

Extension of Benefits
Claims are paid in the order which they are received. If you have an account balance in your prior plan year account and submit a claim for service during the grace period (up to March 15 of the following year), the expense will automatically be paid from your prior plan year’s account.

Because of this, it is important that you file claims in the order that your expenses are incurred. This will help to assure that you maximize the use of your accounts for both plan years.

2020 and 2021 Plan Year Relief under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and IRS Notice 2021-15

Please note that the grace periods for the 2020 and 2021 plan years have been extended as follows:

Plan year 2020 grace period extended to March 15, 2022.

Plan year 2021 grace period extended to March 15, 2023.

If you have claims that were processed under the 2021 plan year instead of the 2020 plan year or which may have been denied in error, please contact ASIFlex at (800) 659-3035 or asi@asiflex.com.

 

Deadline to Claim Funds
You must submit claims for services provided in 2022 by June 30, 2023.

You must submit claims for services provided in 2021 by June 30, 2023.

You must submit claims for services provided in 2020 by June 30, 2022.

Use It or Lose It
Any funds left in your account after the June 30 deadline will be forfeited.

Important Reminders
Once an election is made after becoming newly eligible or experiencing a permitting event, you must experience another permitting event to change your election, even if you are still within the 60-day time period.

IRS rules allow coverage of married and unmarried dependent children under their parents’ health and dental plans up to age 26. You may submit claims for reimbursement for medical expenses for dependents that are under the age of 26 at any time during the plan year.​

Mileage Rate
2022: The mileage rate for medical purposes is 18 cents per mile.

2021: The mileage rate for medical purposes is 16 cents per mile.

2020: The mileage rate for medical purposes is 17 cents per mile.

Tax Benefits
Money deducted from your paycheck for a reimbursement account and the reimbursement payments are not taxable, which lowers your tax liability.

Actual tax savings vary from one individual to another, depending on deduction amount, salary, marital status, exemptions, and participation in other tax savings programs such as Savings Plus. See the 2022 FlexElect Handbook (PDF) for a sample calculation.

Some employees may prefer to claim their dependent care expenses on their tax return instead of through a reimbursement account. This topic is explained further in the dependent care reimbursement account section. Before you make a final decision to enroll in a reimbursement account, it is a good idea to check with a tax advisor if you are unsure which option offers you the best tax advantage.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/general-benefits/flexelect-reimbursement-accounts/,General Benefits
FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts,"Reimbursement Claim Instructions
Step 1
Fill out the CalHR 351 – FlexElect Reimbursement Claim Form.

Step 2
Submit the required documentation for each expense you are claiming.

Medical Reimbursement Account Claims
If claiming reimbursement from a medical account, attach a statement of services, itemized bill, explanation of benefits statement, or other documentation showing the date of service, type of service, and amount you are responsible for paying. A cancelled check, credit card receipt or account statement is not sufficient.

Dependent Care Reimbursement Account Claims
If claiming reimbursement from a dependent care account, attach a statement signed by your provider or have your provider sign in the space provided on the claim form. If you attach a statement, it must show the provider’s name, beginning and ending dates of the dependent care service that was provided, the amount, and the provider’s tax I.D. or Social Security Number. If your provider signs the claim form, the information above needs to be included on the form.

You may submit claims as often as you like. If you pay your provider in advance, you may prefer to submit your claims every week or two rather than waiting until the end of the month. We suggest making extra copies of your original statement if you plan to submit claims more frequently. You can also break down your monthly payment into weekly or biweekly service periods and pro-rate the expense on your claim form.

Step 3
You have several options for submitting claims.

Mail: Mail claim forms to:

Application Software Inc. 
P.O. Box 6044
Columbia, MO 65205-6044

Fax: Fax claim forms and supporting documentation to ASIFlex at (877) 879-9038

Your Mobile Device: Download the app at ca.asiflex.com and view the “how-to” video

Step 4
Once your claim form is processed, a reimbursement check is mailed to your home or direct deposited into your bank account.

Additional Information
Your check will be mailed to the address that SCO has on file for you. For that reason, it is important that you verify with your department’s personnel office that SCO has your correct address on file. If the address is incorrect, or you move while enrolled, you need to complete an Employee Action Request (STD. 686) so SCO can update its records. This form is available from your department’s personnel office.

You may also sign up for direct deposit in lieu of receiving a physical check by logging into your ASIFlex account at ca.asiflex.com. Be sure to verify your account information prior to submitting your request to ensure there are no delays in receiving your reimbursements.

Claim Rejection Procedure
If your claim is rejected, partially or in full, ASIFlex will send you a rejection letter. If your claim is received during the run-out period (January through June of the following plan year), and additional documentation is required, you have 60 calendar days from the date listed on the rejection letter to resubmit. You should include the rejection letter along with the documentation being resubmitted. ​",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/general-benefits/flexelect-reimbursement-accounts/,General Benefits

​Website Assistance
​General account information is available on the ASIFlex website.​

Payment Dates
Reimbursement account claims are paid twice a week. The average turnaround time between submission of a claim and the issuance of the check is two weeks. Payments for dependent care reimbursement account claims require that the funds be available in your account and the service period has passed.

The minimum reimbursement amount that will be paid from your account is $10. If you submit a claim for less than $10, the payment will be held until your total reimbursement equals $10 or more. If you have less than $10 in your account, ASIFlex will run a report twice a year in June and December to identify small claims and pay them.

Permanent-Intermittent Employees–Time Base Changes​​
If you are appointed to a permanent position with a time base of half-time or more, you will be eligible for a reimbursement account. If you want to enroll in a medical reimbursement account or dependent care reimbursement account, you must complete a Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization Form within 60 days of the date of your appointment. Conversely, if you change from permanent status to permanent-intermittent, you lose eligibility for the reimbursement account, unless you choose to continue your deductions under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). COBRA can be used for medical reimbursement accounts only.

Grace Period
Medical and dependent care flexible reimbursement accounts allow for a grace period immediately following the end of each plan year. Expenses incurred during the grace period may be claimed against any unused contributions from the plan year. The grace periods for both the medical and dependent care flexible reimbursement accounts extend for a period of two months and 15 days immediately following the end of each plan year. You may use money deducted in 2022 to pay for medical and dependent care expenses incurred up to March 15, 2023.

Please note that the grace periods for the 2020 and 2021 plan years have been extended as follows:

Plan year 2020 grace period extended to March 15, 2022.

What happens to my claims during the grace period if I have a reimbursement account for the previous and current year?

Claims will be paid in the order in which they are received. You may not request that a claim be paid from a specific plan year.

Why Healthier U
Since state employees spend most of their waking hours at work, the State of California wants to create a workplace that promotes and sustains a culture of health to enhance the overall well-being of the state workforce so that employees are happy, healthy, and productive.

A 2012 Urban Institute Study of CalPERS medical care expenditures in 2008 found that 22.4 percent ($362 million) was attributable to chronic diseases amenable to prevention through changes in diet and physical activity. A five percent reduction among state employees in the prevalence of preventable conditions could save the state $18 million annually.

Healthier U is about improving productivity, lowering absenteeism and reducing workers’ compensation claims. It’s about helping employees meet their wellness goals so they can lead healthy lives at work and at home.

Making Workplace Wellness Work: A Labor Management Approach
Healthier U was developed by a unique partnership between CalHR, SEIU Local 1000, State Treasurer’s Office, State Controller’s Office, CalPERS, Kaiser Permanente and Sierra Health Foundation with support from The California Endowment and The California Wellness Foundation.

Healthier U is built on a unique labor-management approach that actively solicits and incorporates employee feedback by:

engaging all levels of the organization;
establishing equal representation of labor and management on committees and workgroups;
building on employees intrinsic motivation through friendly competition and peer support;
securing executive leadership support;
actively utilizing “boosters” or wellness champions to make small changes in their individual work areas and to help support wellness efforts; and
meeting employees where they are so employees can pursue their own personal goals.
Each Healthier U program is unique to the department that is building it.

It is not a one-size fit all.
It is not a wellness program in a box.
It is your wellness program designed by and for you.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/employee-wellness-program/,Work & Engagement Resources

Frequently Asked Questions
Can an employee who has completed 25-years of state service and plans on retiring, regardless of the time between the two events, receive both a 25-Year Service Award and Retirement Award?
Yes. There is nothing in the current law that indicates an employee must choose between the 25-Year Service Award and Retirement Award.

Can a retiring employee who has completed 25-years of state service combine the 25-Year Service Award and Retirement Award and purchase a $250 gift?
No. These are two separate awards.

Can an employee receive the appropriated $125 in cash?
No. The law states “a certificate, plaque, or other suitable memento.” Cash is not considered a “suitable memento” since the definition of memento is “a reminder or a souvenir.”

Does a department have to purchase a gift from the State Price Schedule service providers?
No, it is not mandatory to purchase a gift from the State Price Schedule service providers although it is highly recommended.

Can an employee who is retiring and does not have 25-years of service purchase a retirement award at their own expense?
No. This award is in recognition of 25-years or more of state service.

Can an employee with 23-years of state service qualify for the 25-Year Service Award and/or Retirement Award if they previously purchased two years of service credit for retirement purposes?
No. Service Awards are based on qualifying months of state service.

If an employee transfers to a new department, can they still receive a 25-Year Service Award from the new department?
Yes. The new department would provide the 25-Year Service Award.

What is the difference between the Core items and the Non-Core items?
The Core items are those most commonly purchased by departments for their employees and include watches, clocks, vases, etc. The two service providers offer additional, or “Non-Core” gift items for purchase. The Core items do not exceed $125. The Non-Core items vary in price.

Can an employee choose a gift from the Non-Core catalog?
Each department may establish their own internal policy for ordering service awards. Please check with your departmental Merit Award Administrator or Human Resources Office.

If my department allows it and I choose a gift from the Non-Core catalog that exceeds $125, how do I pay for it?
The State of California is responsible for the first $125, plus the tax on the $125. The employee is responsible for the balance. Employees may contact their department Merit Award Administrator or Human Resources Office for further details.

Current State Employees
Current state employees may be eligible to submit reimbursement claims for allowable, state-approved relocation expenses. Depending on the circumstances of the relocation, relocation reimbursement for allowable expenses may be either mandatory or permissive, conditional, and must be approved in advance. An example of a mandatory circumstance may be a promotion. An example of a permissive circumstance may be an unusual and unavoidable hardship or a hard-to-fill position. Certain allowable relocation circumstances and/or expenses may require advance approval from the Department of Human Resources (CalHR) in addition to the required advance approval by the appointing power (hiring agency or department). Since each relocation situation is unique, employees who have inquiries about the relocation policy should contact their employer for guidance.

New-Hires to State Service
New-hires to state service may be eligible to submit reimbursement claims for allowable, state-approved relocation expenses. Typically, relocation reimbursement for allowable expenses for new-hires to state service is permissive (not mandatory), conditional, and must be approved in advance.

Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program,"Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program
​​This is not a subsidy program. The California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) administers the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program (Program). CalHR contracts with a third-party vendor, Application Software, Inc. (ASI) for recordkeeping and claims adjudication.

General Information
You may participate in this program if you are a state employee who does not have access to state-controlled or owned (DGS, CalTrans, etc.) parking spaces or a department-sponsored parking program.

The Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program is a voluntary payroll deduction program that allows you to deduct a specific dollar amount for work-related parking fees from your pay warrant prior to tax deductions; this reduces your taxable income. The funds taken out of your pay warrant go into a special reimbursement account that you will claim against. To receive payments from your account, you must submit a reimbursement claim form (CalHR 681) along with the required parking receipts. To enroll in this program you must submit the account enrollment form (CalHR 682).

Once the deduction begins for the Program it will continue without interruption until you stop or change it.

At the end of the tax year, the State Controller’s Office (SCO) will report your taxable income as usual, excluding the amount of the pre-tax parking deduction from your gross taxable income. For the 2023 tax year, you can deduct your actual cost of parking, up to $300​ per month.

The Program is governed by section 132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code – Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits.

The Internal Revenue Code defines “qualified parking” as:

Parking on or near the employer’s business premise or at a location from which the employee commutes to work by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire, or by any other means.

Unless you meet certain specific criteria, the Internal Revenue Code does not allow for automatic refunds of excess money in your Program Account. Please read the Frequently Asked Questions and Forfeiture Information below.

For questions concerning the status of a claim or your account balance, please contact the third party vendor Application Software, Inc. (ASI) at (800) 659-3035 or visit the ASI website.

Dependent Re-Verification,"Dependent Re-Verification
Introduction
The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) is the process of re-verifying the eligibility of spouses, domestic partners, children, stepchildren, and domestic partner children (family members) for their continued enrollment for state health, dental and premier vision benefits. Government Code section 19815.9 mandates re-verifying the eligibility of these family members. Government Code section 22959 authorizes extending this review to family members enrolled in dental benefits.  The bargaining unit contracts specify that family member eligibility for dental benefits shall be the same as that prescribed for health benefits.

The DRV began in 2018. The eligibility of family members is re-verified once every three years. The re-verification period is based on the employee’s birth month.  Government Code 19815.9 also requires the employing office to:

Verify the eligibility of all dependents prior to enrolling them in health, dental and vision benefits
Retain and maintain a record of the verifying documentation for each dependent in the employee’s official personnel file
Validate/re-verify dependent eligibility at least once every three years for most dependents
Remove unverified dependents from benefits coverage

Dependent Re-Verification,"The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) Program   The DRV program was implemented as a cost mitigation strategy for state departments effective in 2018. In an effort to control rising health care costs, CalPERS conducted a Dependent Eligibility Verification (DEV) of its membership during fiscal year 2013-14 utilizing a vendor. The DEV required departmental personnel offices to verify the eligibility of employee dependents for continued enrollment in state-sponsored health benefits. The DEV efforts resulted in cancellations of 8,379 ineligible dependents enrolled in health and resulted in a savings of over $60 million by reducing future claims and employer contribution costs. The success of the DEV led to the adoption of Senate Bill 98, Chapter 28, Statutes of 2015, adding Government Code (GC) Section 22843.1 to the Public Employees’ Medical & Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). GC 22843.1 implemented a permanent DRV process for departmental personnel offices, requiring departments to verify the continued eligibility of employee dependents for state-sponsored health benefits on a triennial basis and mandated CalHR to set the standards. On July 16, 2021, Assembly Bill 138, Chapter 78, Statutes of 2021, was signed into law, and the DRV authority was removed from PEMHCA and added to CalHR GC 19815.9. Authority was given to CalHR to set the Dependent Re-verification (DRV) standards pursuant to GC 19815.9. In addition, Title 2, Section 599.855 of the California Code of Regulations clarifies and makes specific the above-mentioned statute for application by state departments.
