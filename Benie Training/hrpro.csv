Benefits payable under this program will be paid to the standard order of beneficiary if one is on file with Metlife.

Employee’s spouse or domestic partner, if alive;
Employee’s child(ren), * if there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner;
Employee’s parent(s), if there is no surviving child*;
Employee’s estate, if there is no surviving parent.
Benefits will be paid equally among surviving children or surviving parents. Family status changes, such as divorce and remarriage are automatically adjusted, provided an employee has not designated a beneficiary other than the above.

Employees who wish to designate a beneficiary other than the standard order stated above must request a beneficiary form from Metlife. The employee must return the completed form to Metlife. Upon receipt of the completed form, Metlife will record and retain the original in the employee’s file. A signed copy will be returned to the employee for his/her records. This designation will not change with marriage, divorce, or any other family status changes. Therefore, employees must complete a new designation form if their family status change alters their desired choice of beneficiaries.

Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1601. General Information
The Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) Program, is administered by the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) Benefits Division. Departments are responsible for ensuring employees are provided information regarding the CoBen benefit. This manual provides departments with information regarding eligibility, enrollment, and available benefits under the CoBen program. The two types of benefits presented under the CoBen program are:

The CoBen Program Benefit Allowance is automatically established in the State Controller’s Office (SCO) payroll system to offset the cost of health, dental, and vision benefits for eligible employees.
The CoBen Program Cash Option is a cash payment option which is paid in lieu of maintaining state-sponsored health or health and dental benefits. This option is available to eligible state employees. Departments are responsible for assisting employees who wish to enroll in CoBen Cash and ensuring all the appropriate documents are completed correctly and timely.
The CoBen Handbook, provides an overview of the program and how it works. The CoBen Handbook should be made available to eligible employees. Personnel Offices may go to the CalHR Benefits Division website to download copies of the CoBen Handbook for employees who do not have internet access.

Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1602. Benefit Allowance
“Benefit Allowance”
The state will establish one combined employer contribution amount for an employee’s health, dental, and state-sponsored vision benefits. The employees’ benefit allowance is automatically established in the SCO payroll system, therefore, no enrollment form is required. The full premium amount id based on the health, dental, and vision plans the employees chooses and is deducted from the employee’s benefit allowance. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the state’s vision plan. The vision benefit is mandatory under CoBen and eligible employees may not cancel their state-sponsored vision coverage.

The employee’s benefit allowance will depend on the number of dependents that the employees covers. If an employees is enrolled in both a state-sponsored health and dental plan, their health benefit enrollment party code will determine the benefit allowance they will receive.

If the total cost of the plans employee’s health, dental, and vision is less than the benefit allowance, the employee will receive the difference as taxable cash (excess cash) in their paycheck. The excess cash amount will be subject to state, federal, and social security taxes. In order to receive excess cash, employees must be enrolled in health, dental, and vision benefits. If employees are not enrolled in all three benefits, they will not be eligible to receive excess cash.

If the total cost of the employee’s health, dental, and vision plans is more than their benefit allowance, the employee pay the difference (out-of-pocket) with pre-tax dollars automatically deducted from their paycheck. The out-of-pocket amount will not be subject to state, federal, and social security taxes.

If an employee enrolls in health and vision only, they will receive the lesser of the total premium cost or the CoBen allowance amount.

If an employee elects to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored health plan but enrolls in a state-sponsored dental plan, the benefit allowance will be the amount of their dental and basic vision premium. In this situation, the employee will receive cash in lieu of qualifying group health coverage and the dental and vision premium will be fully paid. The employee will not have an out-of-pocket dental and vision premium cost.

The CoBen Program Benefit Allowance will automatically stop at the time of retirement, separation, or loss of eligibility. At retirement, the health and dental deduction (if any) will be shown as the state share and retiree share of the applicable premiums. The Personnel Office is required to offer COBRA continuation for state-sponsored vision coverage at the time of retirement. The state will continue to fully pay the state-sponsored basic vision premium for eligible active employees.

Represented Employee CoBen Allowance
The CoBen allowance for represented employees is determined through collective bargaining.

The collective bargaining process is fluid and the CoBen allowance for represented employees may change. CalHR will notify departments if there are changes to these rates.

2023 CoBen Allowances

Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1603. Benefits Calculator
The Benefits Calculator helps employees in CoBen determine how much will be deducted from or added to their paycheck based on which health and dental plans they choose. State vision coverage is mandatory under CoBen and the vision amount is automatically added into the calculation.

The CoBen handbook includes a worksheet that employees may fill out to help them calculate their benefit costs. However, the CoBen calculator has the advantage of being easier to use and allowing employees to try different scenarios. An employee simply clicks on his or her health and dental plan choices and indicates how many dependents will be covered. The calculator automatically computes the total cost of the benefits and subtracts it from the CoBen allowance. The result shows whether the employee will have a monthly benefit deduction or receive extra cash and the amount of the deduction or cash.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-benefits-coben/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1604. CoBen Cash
“Cash Option”
Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their own State- sponsored health insurance or health and dental insurance plan. Employees may not elect to receive cash in lieu of dental coverage only. Employees must certify they have qualifying group health and/or dental coverage through a spouse, domestic partner, or another source to be eligible for cash option.

Group coverage is typically maintained by an employer or employee organization and must conform to the federal Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) minimum value standards.  The ACA establishes a minimum value standard of benefits of a health plan.  For a qualifying group health plan to meet the ACA’s minimum value standards, the plan must cover at least 60 percent of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan.

All CalPERS-sponsored health plans meet the minimum value standards.  Employees covered under individual coverage, such as TRICARE, Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Covered California are not eligible for the CoBen Cash, even if they meet the minimum value standards.

Cash Option payments are taxable and the amounts are listed below:

$155 per month in lieu of health and dental insurance
$130 per month in lieu of health only
Employees in CoBen are eligible for the CoBen Cash Option in lieu of health or health and dental benefits, therefore, they are not eligible for the State’s FlexElect Cash Option Program. Retired employees are not eligible for CoBen Cash.

Employees who are not currently enrolled in the CoBen Cash Option and wish to enroll in the Cash Option for the next Plan Year, must complete a Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) Cash Enrollment Election (STD. 702) during an open enrollment period or as newly eligible. The CoBen Cash Plan Year is January 1 through December 31.

Employees who are currently enrolled in the Cash Option will be automatically reenrolled into the Cash Option for the next plan year. It is not necessary for these employees to complete a Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) Cash Enrollment Election (STD. 702) during a CoBen Cash Open Enrollment Period, unless they wish to cancel or change their Cash Option Enrollment.

Under the Internal Revenue Code governing the CoBenProgram, employees who enroll or make changes to their Cash Option during an Open Enrollment Period may cancel or change their election through December 31. This rule also applies to employees who are automatically reenrolled in the Cash Option. Accordingly, if employees wish to cancel their automatic Cash Option reenrollment after the Open Enrollment Period has ended, they may do so, provided it is done on or before December 31 in the same year.

Eligible employees enrolled in CoBen Cash may also enroll in the State’s FlexElect Program’s, Dependent Care Reimbursement Account and/or Medical Reimbursement Account. Departments should reference the Benefits Administration Manual (BAM) Section 700 for the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts eligibility/enrollment criteria.
Permanent-Intermittent (PI) employees wishing to participate in the Cash Option, will not have their enrollment automatically continued. PI employees are required to complete a STD. 702 each year they wish to receive the Cash Option.
If the employee is not enrolled in a state-sponsored health and/or dental plan at the time of his/her death, then the surviving spouse and dependents can’t enroll in a medical or dental plan unless the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) determines they’re eligible for survivor benefits.
Employees who are eligible to receive survivor benefits after the death of the spouse or domestic partner can continue to receive CoBen Cash.
Dental Cash Option Three-Year Commitment
Once enrolled in the Dental Cash Option, the employee is obligated to stay in the Dental Cash for three plan years.  After completion of the three plan year commitment, employees may enroll in a State dental plan during the next open enrollment period.  The Personnel Office should take steps to monitor the three-year commitment and ensure compliance when employees request cash option enrollment/changes during or after the open enrollment period. After completing the three-year commitment, employees may enroll in a dental plan during the open enrollment period. There is no three-year commitment for employees who are not enrolled in the Cash Option.

Exception to the three-year commitment:

Lose their other dental coverage;
Cancel both their health and dental CoBen Cash during an open enrollment period; or
Due to a valid permitting event under the CoBen Program.

If one of these events occurs, then the employee may enroll in a dental plan prior to the end of the three-year commitment period.

Delta Dental Plan 24-Month Restriction
Employees in CoBen do not serve the State Dental Program’s Delta Dental 24-month restriction period. Newly hired employees and those employees who transfer from a Bargaining Unit not eligible for CoBen to a Bargaining Unit eligible for CoBen, including those employees who are currently serving the 24-month restriction will be allowed to enroll or change to a Delta Dental plan.

Administrative Fee
Employees who enroll in the CoBen Cash Option in lieu of enrolling in State-sponsored benefits, will not pay a monthly administrative fee. Those employees enrolled in CoBen Cash and a FlexElect Program Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Account will pay a $1.00 monthly administrative fee. The administrative fee will be deducted from their after tax salary each month. The administrative fee will be determined each year by the CalHR.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-benefits-coben/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1605. Premium Only Plan (POP)
Under the State’s Premium Only Plan any out-of-pocket premium cost to employees for their State-sponsored health, dental, and vision insurance cost (in excess of their CoBen allowance) is taken out of their paycheck before federal, state, and social security taxes are deducted (pre-tax basis). This tax savings helps to offset some of their insurance premium cost. All employees in CoBen who pay an out-of-pocket share for their State-sponsored health, dental, and vision premiums are automatically enrolled into Premium Only Plan.

In addition, as the employees’ CoBen allowance and/or insurance premiums increase or decrease, the employees’ share will automatically change and continue to be deducted from their paycheck as long as they are enrolled in POP.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-benefits-coben/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"Enrollment into POP
Enrollment into Premium Only Plan is automatic for all employees in CoBen who pay an out-of-pocket amount for health, dental, and vision premiums. Premium Only Plan is mandatory under CoBen and employees may not disenroll. There is not a monthly administrative fee for Premium Only Plan participants.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-benefits-coben/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"Benefit Allowance – Out of Pocket Cost
If the total cost of the plans employees choose is more than their CoBen allowance, they pay the difference (out-of-pocket) with pre-tax dollars automatically deducted from their paycheck. The out-of-pocket amount will not be subject to state, federal, and social security taxes.

Should an employee only enroll into one of the benefits (dental or health), along with the mandatory vision plan enrollment, the employee’s allowance will be the sum of premium cost only, or the maximum contribution amount, based on the dental or health party code (based on the actual enrollment), whichever is less.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-benefits-coben/,Benefits Administration Manual

Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1609. Open Enrollment Period
The Open Enrollment Period to enroll in CoBen Cash is held in the fall and coincides with the Dental and Health open enrollment period. Employees must sign and submit their CoBen Cash form, including HBD-12’s and STD. 692’s to their Personnel Office no later than the last day of the open enrollment period. Any change in the open enrollment period dates will be communicated to departments prior to the beginning of the open enrollment period. The effective date of action during open enrollment is January 1, of the following year.

A memo that includes specific open enrollment information regarding permitting event date, effective date, permitting event code, and cutoff dates for submission of CoBen forms to the State Controller’s Office (SCO) will be sent by CalHR to departments prior to the beginning of the open enrollment period.

Cash Option Enrollments/Reenrollments
Employees currently enrolled in the Cash Option will be automatically reenrolled into CoBen Cash for the next Plan Year. It is not necessary for these employees to complete a Consolidated Benefits Cash Enrollment Election (STD. 702) during the Open Enrollment Period, unless they wish to cancel or change their Cash Option Enrollment.

Employees who are not currently enrolled in the CoBen Cash Option, and wish to enroll in the Cash Option for the next Plan Year, must complete a STD. 702 during the CoBen Open Enrollment Period.

Exception to Automatic Reenrollment
Permanent-Intermittent (PI) employees, wishing to participate in the Cash Option, must reenroll each CoBen Open Enrollment Period in order to receive the Cash Option. The automatic enrollment continuation does not apply to PIs because part of their eligibility requires completion of a specific number of work hours each plan year and a separate payment process.

If enrollment forms (i.e., HBD-12 and/or STD. 692) are also being submitted for the spouse/ domestic partner of an employee, they must be coordinated and submitted as a package, along with the employee’s STD. 702 form.

Consolidated Benefits (CoBen),"1611. Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Employees
Permanent-Intermittent (PI) employees may enroll in CoBen Cash, but have limited eligibility. PI employees are not eligible to enroll in a Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Account under the FlexElect Program.

All PI employees who expect to qualify for CoBen Cash during the next plan year must make an election to enroll in the Cash Option during the CoBen Open Enrollment Period by completing a Consolidated Benefits Cash Enrollment Election (STD. 702). Participation in CoBen Cash will be contingent on meeting the required eligibility criteria.

In order to participate in POP, PI employees must qualify for health/dental/vision benefits by earning at least 480 paid hours during each control period (January through June and July through December) or at least 960 paid hours during two consecutive control periods (prior and current). If after enrolling in a health, dental, and state-sponsored basic vision plan, PI employees pay an out-of-pocket premium deduction, it will automatically be deducted on a pretax basis. Since POP enrollment is automatic there are no enrollment forms required.

Cash Option – PI Employees
PI employees do not receive the Cash Option on a monthly basis.  Instead, they receive the Cash as a single, lump sum six-month payment in lieu of enrollment in a State-sponsored health and/or dental plan for the January through June control period of each plan year for which they are enrolled.  They are not eligible to receive the Cash for the July through December control period because such payment would not be made until the next plan year.  Cash Option payments made in a subsequent plan year are considered a deferral of compensation and is strictly prohibited by the IRS.  Cash Option payments are taxable and available to PI employees as follows:

$930 lump-sum payment in lieu of health and dental insurance
$780 lump-sum payment in lieu of health only
PI Eligibility for Cash Option

have a PI appointment from January 1 through June 30 of the Plan Year for which they have enrolled (with no break in service).
*In situations where an employee maintains multiple PI appointments during the January through June control period, the department may count the hours worked from the multiple positions regardless of whether the multiple positions are within one department or multiple departments.

*PI’s may not use NDI or SDI time to count towards their 480 qualifying hours in a control period to qualify for the lump-sum cash payment.

Form Submission for Cash Option – PI Employees
The following information covers the types of actions, which can occur during the open enrollment period.

Employees who were eligible for health and/or dental but were not currently enrolled and were electing the Cash Option in lieu of health or health and dental.
These employees must have completed a STD. 702 during the open enrollment period. On or after July 1, Personnel Offices will verify the qualifying hours during the January-June control period. For those employees who worked the required 480 hours AND meet the other eligibility criteria, the STD. 702 should be forwarded along with a STD. 674 to SCO to request the cash option payment. In the Remarks section of the STD. 674 put the following language:  I certify this PI employee has worked 480 hours during the January – June YEAR Control Period and meets all other eligibility criteria for the CoBen Cash Option payment of $xxx.00.
Employees who cancelled their health and/or dental benefits effective January 1 in order to obtain the Cash Option in lieu of health or health and dental.
During the open enrollment period, these employees would have completed a STD. 702 AND in addition an HBD-12 and/or a STD. 692 to cancel their current benefits effective January 1. The HBD-12 and/or STD. 692 should have been forwarded immediately to SCO as instructed below:
Permitting Event Code: 36a (For STD. 692)
Reason Code: 503 (For HBD-12)
Remarks Section for both HBD-12 and STD. 692: “PI canceling benefits to enroll in CoBen Cash Option”

Personnel Office retains the STD. 702 until completion of the January through June control period.
If employee meets Cash Option eligibility the STD. 702 is sent to SCO with a STD. 674 requesting the cash option payment.
Document Submission Deadline for Cash Option Payment
The STD. 702 and STD. 674 for PI employees who qualify for a six-month lump sum cash payment must be received at SCO by September 1st. All requests received at SCO after the cut-off date will be returned unprocessed to the Personnel Office.

Note: When the 1st is on a weekend or holiday, than the cut-off date will be on the next regular workday.

Following are some examples of different scenarios of CoBen Cash options employees may choose. With every different situation and dates involved, the form(s) will be completed differently.

Each example begins with an explanation of the employee’s current status, his/her desired CoBen election, and the actions required by the Employee, his/her Spouse or Domestic Partner, and the Personnel Office.

In all examples, the “employee” is the State employee and is the principal figure in the scenario. The “employee’s spouse or domestic partner” in some examples is a State employee or may be employed by private industry.

The explanation of each scenario is followed by a correctly completed sample of every enrollment form required to complete the employee’s desired elections.
The examples in this manual do not reflect every possible type of enrollment within the CoBen Cash Option but hopefully do provide a broad enough basis to guide the Personnel Office through typical enrollment situations.

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"401. General Information
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives workers and their families who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health benefits provided by their group health plan for limited periods of time under certain circumstances such as voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce, and other life events.

COBRA generally requires that group health plans sponsored by employers with 20 or more employees in the prior year offer employees and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage (called continuation coverage) in certain instances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end.

The State of California offers continuation of benefit coverage to covered employees, spouses, domestic partners , and dependent children who lose group coverage due to a qualifying event.  The health, dental, vision, and medical reimbursement accounts may qualify for continuation of coverage after a permitting event.

Plan coverage can be continued for a maximum of 18 or 36 months depending on the qualifying event. Premiums are calculated at 102 percent of the total group rate and are paid by the enrollee directly to the plan on a monthly basis.

HR offices are responsible for providing covered individuals with the three required COBRA notices and assistance in completing the COBRA enrollment forms when required.

The three required COBRA notices are:

Initial General COBRA Notice – Provides the covered individual(s) with a summary of their rights, options, and notification responsibilities under the COBRA law.
COBRA Election Notice – Informs the covered individual(s) of their loss of group coverage and their right to enroll in continuation coverage using the attached COBRA election form.
Unavailability of Coverage Notice – Informs the covered individual(s) of their ineligibility to enroll in continuation coverage due to failure of the employee to inform their HR office of a COBRA qualifying event in a timely manner.
Good Faith Compliance Standard

Each department should operate its COBRA function in good faith compliance with a reasonable interpretation of the statutory standards. To show evidence of good faith compliance, departments must develop standard operating procedures, provide timely notices, retain copies of notices and signed election forms, provide COBRA training to staff, and continuously audit compliance.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"402. Qualified Beneficiary
A qualified beneficiary is an individual (employee or dependent) that is eligible to continue group coverage due to a COBRA qualifying event. The individual must have been covered under the plan before the qualifying event date. If the individual was not covered, he or she is not eligible for COBRA. Please note COBRA will only be offered to dependents considered eligible based on Public Employee Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMCHA) law.

A child enrolled in group coverage when ordered by a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) or Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) is deemed a qualified beneficiary under COBRA law, regardless of his or her status as a dependent of the covered employee. The HR office must send an Initial General Notice to the custodial parent or guardian in care of the child, or agency that sent the NMSN or QMCSO (as a substitute, if child’s address is unknown).

Non-resident aliens (with no U.S. income) are ineligible for COBRA continuation coverage.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"403. Initial General COBRA Notice
The Initial General COBRA Notice provides a summary of the covered individual’s rights, options, and notification responsibilities under the COBRA law. This notice must contain the following information:

Description of COBRA terms
Name of the employee, spouse/domestic partner, and *dependent children
Summary of continuation benefits
List of qualifying events
Outline of employee/dependent notification responsibilities
*Departments may state “and all dependent children” in lieu of listing each dependent child’s name.

90-Day Notice Period

The HR office must provide the Initial General COBRA Notice to covered individuals within 90 days of the coverage effective date. An exception to the 90 day rule is when a qualifying event occurs before the initial notice is provided to the employee. When this occurs, the HR office must include an initial notice to the employee, along with the election notice and election form.

The HR office must indicate, in the Initial General COBRA Notice, each benefit in which the employee and dependents are enrolled (Health, Dental, and Vision). Medical Reimbursement Accounts (MRA) have a separate initial COBRA notice, containing information specific to the MRA.

Adding Dependents or Changing Plans (Including Open Enrollment)

When an employee adds a spouse or domestic partner, or changes plans, an Initial General COBRA Notice must be provided to the employee and newly covered spouse/domestic partner.

Court Orders

Dependent Child: If the HR office receives a court order that requires enrollment of a child to an employee’s group coverage, then the HR office must send the Initial General COBRA Notice to each parent (two separate letters) as listed on the court order. If one of the parents’ address is unknown, the HR office must send an Initial General COBRA Notice to the agency that sent the court order.

Spouse: If the HR office receives a court order that requires enrollment of an employee’s spouse, the HR office must send the Initial General COBRA Notice to the spouse, or agency that sent the court order (as a substitute, if spouse’s address is unknown).

Approved Notice Delivery Methods

COBRA law requires that notices must be furnished to covered individuals. The preferred method of delivery is First Class Mail. Proof of receipt is not required if mailed to the last known address. Departments must maintain a copy of each notice sent, along with logging the recipient’s name, address, and date mailed.

Initial General COBRA Notice Log

The Initial General COBRA Notice Log is used to track the date and delivery method used to provide the notice.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"404. COBRA Qualifying Events
A COBRA qualifying event is an event which results in a loss of group coverage. Each qualifying event results in a specific number of months of continuation coverage.

​Qualifying Event	​Length of Continuation Coverage
​Reduction of Hours (resulting in loss of coverage)*	​18 Months
​Voluntary or Involuntary Termination of Employment (excluding gross misconduct)**	​18 Months
​Divorce/Annulment, Termination of Domestic Partnership, or Legal Separation	​36 Months
​Child ceases to be a Dependent (e.g. child turns 26)	​36 Months
​Death of Employee	​36 Months
*Reduction of hours includes:

Movement to a non-benefit eligible position
Reduction to less than half time
Strikes
Layoffs
Leave of Absence (See Section 406)
Permanent Intermittent Employee (who loses coverage based on a non-qualifying control period
Military call-up (24 months of coverage)
**Retirement is considered a termination of employment

120-Day Death Benefit for Continuation of Benefits
Under the 120-day death benefit, departments are required to continue to pay full premiums to continue coverage for a covered employee’s spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family members for 120 days following an employee’s death. The 120-day period provides the family with a grace period while CalPERS determines if the spouse, domestic partner or other family members are eligible for a survivor’s benefit.

In implementing this benefit, departments will use the process used for an employee on an unpaid leave of absence (STD. 696.) Under this process, the deceased employee’s department will pay four months of both the employer and employee contributions directly to the plan carriers.

An eligible spouse, domestic partner, and/or other eligible dependent who is determined to be an eligible survivor and receives a continuing allowance from CalPERS may continue coverage as an annuitant.

If CalPERS determines that the spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family member is not eligible for survivor benefits, then the department should notify the spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family member of COBRA eligibility within sixty days from the date CalPERS makes this determination. Upon notice of COBRA eligibility by the department, it is the responsibility of the spouse, domestic partner, or other eligible family member to elect and pay monthly premiums directly to the plan(s) in the manner prescribed in the COBRA Election Notice.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"405. Retiree Benefit Plan Alternate Coverage
When the terms and conditions of a retiree benefit plan are different than the terms and conditions that are in place for active employees (e.g. an increase in required premiums, a reduction of benefits, etc.), that plan is considered alternate coverage. COBRA law requires an offer of COBRA continuation coverage in these situations.

Delta Dental PPO plus Premier Enhanced

Upon retirement, an excluded employee enrolled in the Delta Dental PPO plus Premier Enhanced plan, may elect to retain the Premier Enhanced plan through COBRA continuation coverage. Otherwise, the employee must elect to change their coverage to the Delta Dental PPO plus Premier Basic plan.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"406. Leaves of Absence (MRA)
Unpaid Leave of Absence

HR offices must offer COBRA continuation coverage to employees enrolled in a medical reimbursement account (MRA) while on an unpaid leave of absence.

Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)

When an employee is called to active duty, HR offices must offer up to 24 months of COBRA continuation coverage to employees and their dependents.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"407. Loss of Group Coverage in Anticipation of a Qualifying Event
State employees are permitted to delete their spouse, domestic partner, or dependent children from group coverage based on a voluntary action (dependents are not allowed to enroll as a dependent on another state employee’s group coverage after a voluntary action until the following open enrollment). These types of deletions are not COBRA qualifying events and the HR office will not offer COBRA continuation coverage. However, if an employee removes their dependent from group coverage in anticipation of a divorce, legal separation, or termination of a domestic partnership, then the deletion cannot be processed until the qualifying event passes, and COBRA coverage must be offered from the first day of the month following the COBRA qualifying event.

Example: An employee wants to delete their spouse prior to divorce. If the divorce process has been initiated, the deletion would be done in anticipation of a COBRA qualifying event and therefore should not be allowed. COBRA coverage must be offered at the time the divorce is finalized. The Initial General COBRA Notice informs employees of their responsibility to report these events to their HR office.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"408. COBRA Election Notice and Election Form
The HR office is required to provide an election notice and election form to covered employees and their qualified beneficiaries within 14 calendar days of a COBRA qualifying event or when the HR office is notified, whichever comes first. The election notice informs covered individuals that they have the right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.

Departments should customize the COBRA election notice to inform the qualified beneficiary of their current benefit plans that are eligible to be continued through COBRA, length of continuation coverage, and the names of any other applicable qualified beneficiaries.

Each covered person whether an employee, spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child has independent election rights, regardless of whether the employee elects COBRA continuation coverage.

14-Day Notice Period
The HR office must provide the COBRA Election Notice and Election Form to qualified beneficiaries within 14 days from the date of the qualifying event or loss of coverage, or when the HR office is notified, whichever comes first.

The Election Form must be signed and returned to the HR office by the date reflected in the Election Notice/Election Form to confirm that COBRA continuation coverage has been elected. If the election form is not returned by the date reflected in the notice/form, then all rights to elect COBRA continuation coverage will end.

Approved Notice Delivery Methods

The COBRA disclosure regulations require that notices must be furnished using measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material. The following are examples of acceptable distribution methods:

first, second, third class mail
certified mail
hand-delivery and
e-mail
HR offices are strongly encouraged to use first class mail, when possible, for tracking purposes.

Single Notice Rule

The HR office sending a single notice to the last known address of the qualified beneficiary, is considered good faith compliance. The notice must be addressed to the employee and spouse or domestic partner. Notification to the covered spouse or domestic partner is deemed notification to the covered dependent children who reside at the same address (including any dependent children covered in the future). The parent or legal guardian of minor children can elect on their behalf. A separate notice is required when the HR office is aware that qualified beneficiaries reside at a different address. Keep a copy in file of the actual notice sent.

To prove that the notice was sent, the HR office should maintain a copy of the notice actually sent (reflecting the name and address where the notice was sent) and maintain evidence that the mailing practice was followed for each notice sent.

COBRA Election Notice Log

HR Offices must use the COBRA Election Notice Log to document the date as well as the address where the Election Notice was mailed.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"409.Notice of Unavailability of Continuation Coverage
If a COBRA qualifying event occurs, and the HR Office determines that an individual is not entitled to elect continuation coverage (i.e. gross misconduct or failure of the employee to notify the HR office within 60 days of a qualifying event), the HR Office must provide a Notice of Unavailability of Continuation Coverage within 14 days of receiving notification. This notice explains why the individual is not entitled to elect continuation coverage. The HR office must keep a copy in the employee’s OPF.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"410. Election Period
Each qualified beneficiary has 60 calendar days from the date of loss of coverage or from the date of the COBRA Election Notice to elect COBRA continuation coverage, whichever date is later. Each qualified beneficiary has independent election rights. The HR Office must identify the last date to elect COBRA continuation coverage on the Election Notice.

If an election period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or Holiday, then the election period will be extended to the next regular workday.

No Coverage During COBRA Election Period

The qualified beneficiaries are not covered under the plan during the election period. Any claim for services occurring on or after the date group coverage ceases will not be paid. However, if COBRA is elected and retroactive premiums are paid as detailed in section 413, COBRA Premiums, then coverage will be retroactive back to the date coverage ceased and any claim for services occurring on or after that date will be processed.

Extension of COBRA Election Timeline

If a qualified beneficiary is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that the person cannot complete the required actions to elect continuation coverage, then the COBRA election period will be extended. This means that the specific timeline is put on hold until such time as the incapacity is resolved or a legal guardian can be named to act on behalf of the beneficiary. The HR Office must consult with its legal counsel for each case prior to making a decision.

AB 1401 – Extension of the Minimum COBRA Coverage Period

Under this California law, employer-sponsored medical plans must allow an extension to COBRA coverage for an enrollee who has exhausted their initial 18 month continuation coverage period for up to 36 months from the date that coverage began. Such extensions are managed by the carrier, and HR offices must refer the inquiring qualified beneficiary to the health carrier for more information.

Secondary COBRA Event occurs during the 18-Month Period

If during the 18 months of continuation coverage, a second event takes place (divorce, termination of domestic partnership, legal separation, death, or a dependent child ceases to be a dependent), then the original 18 months of continuation coverage can be extended to 36 months from the original date of loss of coverage for eligible dependent qualified beneficiaries. In no event will continuation coverage last beyond 36 months from the original date of loss of coverage. If a second event occurs, it is the qualified beneficiary’s responsibility to notify the plan in writing within 60 days of the second event and within the original 18-month COBRA timeline.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"411. Premium Payments
Premium Payment

If COBRA is elected, the cost for coverage will be 100 percent of the total premium, plus a 2 percent administration fee which is paid monthly by the enrolled qualified beneficiary to the plan carrier or its designee. The plan carrier or its designee is not required to send a monthly bill. The department is not required to pay a share of the COBRA premium. If there is a change in future premium rates, the carrier will notify the enrolled qualified beneficiary prior to the new premium rates going into effect.

Retroactive Premium Payment

Once COBRA is elected, the enrollee has 45 calendar days from the date of election to pay all retroactive premiums to the plan or its designee. The retroactive premium payment is the premium to cover the period from the date of loss of coverage to the date of election. All claims occurring during the months of retroactivity are held pending premium payment being received.

The employee is responsible for paying the retroactive premium payment directly to the carrier. The department shall not collect and submit the initial payment for them.

Future Monthly Premiums

Once the enrollee pays the retroactive premium, future monthly premiums are due by the first of each following month (Please see Section 421 – Carrier Contact Information). While due on the first, the enrollee has a maximum thirty (30) day grace period following the due date in which to make these premium payments. All claims occurring during the month are held pending premium payment being received. If the applicable payment is not made within the grace period, then coverage is cancelled back to the end of the prior month in which a premium payment had been received. Once COBRA coverage is cancelled due to nonpayment of COBRA premiums the enrollee will not be reinstated.

Extension of COBRA Payment Timeline

If an enrollee is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that the person cannot pay the required premium, then the COBRA payment timeline will be extended. This means that the specific timeline is put on hold until such time as the incapacity is resolved or a legal guardian can be named to act on behalf of the enrollee. The HR office should refer all inquiries to the plan or its designee.

Payment Options

The HR office should direct inquiries regarding partial payments or other potential payment options to the carrier. For more information, the HR office should refer employees to the Carrier Contact Information section on the Employee COBRA webpage.

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,"416. Loss of COBRA Continuation Coverage
At the end of the continuation coverage timeframe (18 or 36 months), COBRA continuation coverage will cease for a COBRA enrollee. The state does not offer any type of conversion plan after the COBRA coverage timeframe expires. The enrollee should contact the carrier directly for information about carrier conversion plans.

The following events may cause loss of COBRA continuation coverage prior to the end of the continuation coverage timeframe:

Employer ceases to provide group coverage plans.
Employee fails to pay required premiums timely.
A qualified beneficiary was extended continuation coverage to 29 months due to a Social Security approved disability and a final determination has been made that the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled.
A qualified beneficiary voluntarily cancels coverage.
A qualified beneficiary becomes covered under Medicare while enrolled in continuation coverage.
For cause, on the same basis that the plan terminates the coverage of similarly situated non-COBRA participants (such as fraud).
All termination of COBRA coverage notices will be provided by the carrier.

Individual Conversion Policy
An Individual Conversion Policy is an alternative to COBRA or can follow COBRA coverage.

They must request this new policy within 30 days of losing coverage. All CalPERS health plans offer this Individual Conversion Policy option but the cost and benefits will differ from previous coverage.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/consolidated-omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act/,Benefits Administration Manual

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA),"The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives workers and their families who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health benefits provided by their group health plan for limited periods of time under certain circumstances such as voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce, and other life events. Qualified beneficiaries may be required to pay the entire premium for coverage up to 102 percent of the cost of the plan.

The COBRA statute requires employers to offer continuation of group coverage including health, dental, vision, and FlexElect Medical Reimbursement Accounts to covered employees, spouses, domestic partners*, and eligible dependent children who lose group coverage due to a qualifying event. These individuals are known as qualified beneficiaries. The terms and timeframes are set by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service.

As a state employee enrolled in state-sponsored benefits, you should be aware of your COBRA rights in the event that you lose coverage due to a qualifying event. You also have the responsibility to report certain life events to your departmental personnel office to ensure you and your qualified dependents maintain COBRA eligibility.

* The state considers a covered domestic partner as a qualified beneficiary who may continue group coverage under COBRA.

Initial General COBRA Notice
Your departmental personnel office will provide the initial general COBRA notice to individuals covered under state-sponsored plans describing your COBRA rights. Your departmental personnel office must provide this notice to covered individuals within the first 90 days of coverage. The notice contains the information that you need to know to protect your COBRA rights while you are covered under the plans. This includes the name of the plan, a general description of the COBRA coverage provided under the plan, departmental personnel office contact information, and an explanation of any notices you must give your departmental personnel office to protect your COBRA rights.

For more information on the program and eligibility, please contact your departmental personnel office.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/general-benefits/cobra/,Benefits Administration Manual

Dental Program,"501.  GENERAL INFORMATION
 

The California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) – Benefits Division has administrative responsibility for the state’s dental insurance program. This administrativ​e responsibility includes securing and administering contracts with dental carriers to provide dental benefits to employees, annuitants/retirees, and their eligible dependents, the development and communication of policies and procedures relating to eligibility and enrollment, the coordination of annual/special open enrollment periods, and providing information and guidance to personnel office staff on issues relating to the state’s dental program.

While CalHR sets policy and procedures on enrollment and eligibility, the actual enrollment documents are reviewed and processed for active employees by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) and for annuitants/retirees by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Only those documents requesting some type of appeal or exception approval are forwarded to CalHR Benefits Division for review.

Dental Program,"502. Current State-Sponsored Dental Plans
The State of California offers several choices when it comes to selecting a dental plan. There are four prepaid plans (DeltaCare USA, Premier Access, SafeGuard and Western Dental) and two PPO/indemnity plans (Delta Dental Preferred Provider Option and Delta Dental PPO plus Premier).

These dental plans provide dental insurance for all eligible active and retired employees and their eligible dependents except for members of Unit 6, whose dental insurance is provided through the California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA) Benefit Trust Fund. In addition, Unit 5 employees who are members of the California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) may enroll in the indemnity dental plan provided by the CAHP Union Trust Plan or in any of the four state-sponsored prepaid dental plans.

*Benefits provided by SafeGuard Health Plans, Inc., a MetLife company.

The following provides a brief description of the three types of dental plans available: prepaid, preferred provider option, and indemnity:

A  prepaid plan requires that the enrollee choose a dentist from a specific list of dentists who contract with each prepaid dental carrier. These dentists make up what is referred to as the carrier’s provider network. Dentists are paid a flat monthly fee by the plan for each member assigned to their offices. Most basic services are covered at no cost to the enrollee. The monthly premium is fully paid by the state and no premium deduction is taken from the employee’s monthly pay warrant.
SafeGuard offers two prepaid plans. Represented employees may enroll in the standard plan. Excluded employees and retirees may enroll in the enhanced plan.
The Delta Dental Preferred Provider Option (PPO), allows enrollees to select any licensed dentist for services. However, enrollees receive the maximum benefit available under the program when they choose one of the plan’s in-network dentists. Similar to the indemnity type plan, individuals who enroll in the plan are required to pay a monthly premium co-payment. Represented, excluded, and retired employees have the same coverage under the PPO plan.
The Delta DentalPPO plus Premier Plans are indemnity plans andallow you to choose to receive services from any licensed dentist,although you may have higher out-of-pocket costs if you receive services from a non-DeltaDental dentist. With an indemnity type plan there are set limits that the plan will pay for each specific type of dental treatment. Enrollees are responsible for paying any remaining balance that might be due based on the type of dental treatment provided. The state pays a share of the monthly premium with the balance deducted from the monthly pay warrant of the employee.
Represented employees and retirees may enroll in the basic plan. Excluded employees may enroll in the enhanced plan.

State Departments
Each department is responsible for notifying its employees of benefit eligibility guidelines, time constraints for enrollment, changes to benefits resulting from movements in and out of bargaining units, and applicable provisions of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) coverage. Departments are also responsible for ensuring that documents are forwarded to the SCO in a timely manner. Each department should ensure that a supply of dental plan information packages for each dental plan are maintained and made available to interested employees. Departments are encouraged to review and refer to the policy and procedures outlined in this section when handling dental eligibility and enrollment issues. If, after thoroughly researching this material, there are issues which cannot be resolved; CalHR is available to provide guidance and assistance.

State Controller’s Office (SCO)
The SCO Benefits Unit, is responsible for processing all dental enrollment/change documents, updating the employees’ payroll/deduction history and forwarding a copy of each enrollment document to the appropriate dental carrier. SCO is also responsible for auditing enrollment documents to ensure the validity of information. Those documents that require correction are returned to the respective employing department for appropriate action. In addition, on approximately the 5th and 20th of each month, the carriers receive eligibility information from SCO via eligibility file.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS)
CalPERS Health Account Services (HAS) is responsible for processing all dental enrollment/change documents for retired state employees.

9. Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Employees
Eligible PI employees who have met the required 24-month restriction period may change to Delta dental during their current PI control period. Those PI employees who are not currently enrolled in a prepaid plan after completion of the 24-month restriction period may only elect to enroll in Delta dental after completion of their current PI control period.  The 24-months begins at their PI appointment, not when they become benefit eligible.

Dental Program,"508. Dependent Eligibility
Dependent Eligibility Definitions for State Employees
Eligible employees may enroll for self only, or self and eligible dependents.

1. Family Member
Family member means an employee’s or annuitant’s spouse (legally married), domestic partner (certified by the Secretary of State), and “eligible child(ren)”. The state dental program does not acknowledge law marriage enrollments.

A copy of a marriage certificate or declaration of domestic partnership must be provided at the time of the initial enrollment of the spouse or domestic partner and maintained in the employee’s personnel folder.

2. Registered Domestic Partner
If a domestic partner is being claimed as an economic dependent for the purposes of an employee’s personal income taxes, the Affidavit for Domestic Partners being claimed as Economic Dependents (CalHR 680) – (Attachment G) must be received by personnel from the employee and maintained in the employee’s official personnel file. The completed STD. 692 to add the dependent to coverage with the appropriate party code designation must be sent to the SCO Benefits Unit for processing.

It is the personnel office responsibility to inform employees regarding the requirements of the CalHR 680 form when adding a domestic partner to their benefits, but it is the employee’s responsibility to understand their tax situation and submit the CalHR 680 to personnel. Employees who add a domestic partner to their coverage, but do not submit a CalHR 680 to personnel will be subject to the federal imputed tax based on the difference between the one- and two-party premiums. SCO will apply the tax withholding on the employee’s warrant based on the party code designation on the STD. 692. For the addition of domestic partners who are not considered “economic dependents” for federal tax purposes, when the partner is added to benefits, the party code must be shown as “A” for party code 2 and “B” for party code 3.

For the addition of domestic partners who are considered “economic dependents” for federal tax purposes, when the partner is added to benefits, the party code would be shown as 2 or 3. In the remarks section of the STD. 692, should reflect “Economic Dependent Domestic Partner – CalHR 680 on File”. This designates to the SCO that no imputed tax is to be withheld.

3. Eligible Dependents/Family Members
Eligible dependents are defined as (1) the legal spouse or domestic partner, and (2) economically dependent children under the age of 26. “Family member” also includes any child for whom the employee or annuitant has assumed a parent-child relationship up to the age of 26. Children include natural, adopted, stepchildren or a child living in a parent-child relationship who is economically dependent upon the employee, or an economically dependent child where economic dependency is created through a change of custody or through a court order.

Employees must complete a State of California Dental Affidavit of Eligibility (CalHR 025) (Attachment D) in order to enroll economically dependent child(ren) who are not their natural, adopted, or stepchild.

CalHR’s dental and vision programs reserve the right to request a birth certificate when there is a questionable enrollment of a dependent child.

Multiple STD 692’s can be submitted to reflect the names, date of birth and family relationship of an employee’s dependent(s) when the maximum number of dependent(s) cannot fit on one form.

In Remarks Section note “form identifies additional dependents enrolled on plan”. Write 1 of 2 and 2 of 2 on the two forms being submitted as one document.

Medically Disabled Eligible Dependent Children
An eligible dependent that is under the age of 26 years and that is enrolled as an eligible family member, may continue to be enrolled after attaining age 26 if he/she is incapable of self-support because of physical disability or mental incapacity and if he/she is dependent upon the eligible employee or annuitant for support and care. A disability certification (CalPERS HBD-34) is required to ensure disabled dependent children remain covered after the age of 26.

The disabled dependent may be continued under such coverage only under the following conditions:
The dependent was enrolled as a disabled child at the time of the employee’s initial enrollment; or
The dependent became disabled while enrolled as an eligible family member prior to attaining age 26.
The following disabled dependent children are excluded from coverage:
Dependent whose disability occurred after age 26.
Dependents over age 26 who were enrolled in, and later deleted from, any state-sponsored dental plan.
Dependents over age 26 who are not currently enrolled in any state-sponsored dental plan.
The employee must provide satisfactory evidence of such disability, within the period starting 60 days before and ending 60 days after the initial enrollment or the dependent’s 26th birthday. An approved copy of the CalPERS Medical Report for Disabled Dependent (HBD-34) (Attachment E) or CalPERS’ letter of approval, should be sent to the dental carrier with a copy of the most recent STD. 692 that lists the disabled child to ensure claims are not denied due to the dependent being over age 26. In addition, the employee may want to encourage their dentist to indicate “Disabled dependent over age 26” on any claims documentation when requesting benefits from carriers. Annual certification of continued disability may be required.

“Family Members” who are not Eligible for Coverage include, but are not Limited to:
A stepchild for whom the employee or annuitant does not provide “parental supervision and substantial financial support” such as in the case of a stepchild not living in the employee’s or annuitant’s household.
An otherwise eligible dependent who is on active duty, U.S. military service.
A disabled child whose disability occurred after age 26.
A child over age 26 who was once certified as eligible and disabled but subsequently is unable to meet certification requirements for continued disability.
Parents, grandparents, common law marriages, children over age 26 unless medically disabled; and
Other relatives or persons not identified as a legal spouse, certified domestic partner or eligible child.
Employees may choose to exclude from coverage dependents who meet any of the following conditions:
A dependent child covered under a non-state-sponsored dental plan.
A spouse not living in the employee’s household, not applicable in the event of a pending divorce, separation, or annulment.
A certified domestic partner not living in the employee’s household.
A child over age 18 or no longer economically dependent.
Employees on Their Parents Plan When Hired
When the parents delete these children from their state-sponsored dental plans, the children should be offered COBRA, regardless of the fact that the children may be eligible to enroll in their own right.

Dual/Split Dental Coverage
State employees may not have dual coverage. At the time a spouse or dependent enrolls as a state employee, coverage as a dependent on a spouse’s or parent’s state dental plan must be terminated on the effective date of the enrollment as an employee.
There is no split coverage allowed. State employees may not split dependent coverage; all dependent children must be enrolled by one state employee. The department must correct these types of enrollments retroactive to the date they began and notify the employee accordingly. Use PEC 42 (enrolled, but not eligible) on the STD. 692 and submit to SCO for corrective action. Employees will be responsible for dental expenses incurred during a period of ineligibility. Departments should ensure that new employee benefit orientation packages provide information regarding dual/split dental coverage.
Employees (including unmarried employees) and/or dependents may not have dual or split coverage under any dental plan offered by the State of California and/or the California State University (CSU) system, including retirees.

Court Ordered Dental Coverage – Family Code section 3760-3773 and 4726
A court order may be issued which could require a dental enrollment action. Each court order contains specific instructions for both the employer and the employee which must be followed. Orders of this type are generally subject to the program’s eligibility rules.

In the event documentation is necessary to add a dependent child or children to an employee’s dental plan, complete a STD. 692 using PEC 16. The Permitting Event Date will be the date of the court order.

If a court order is issued and an employee has voluntarily deleted a spouse, the personnel office should reenroll the spouse until the divorce becomes final. When the divorce becomes final, the ex-spouse must be mandatorily deleted from coverage and becomes eligible for COBRA. Use PEC 17a or 21a to reenroll. The Permitting Event Date will be the date of the court order.

When completing a STD. 692 resulting from a court order, indicate in the remarks section “Court Ordered”. If an employee refuses to sign the enrollment form, the personnel office should indicate “Administrative Addition of Dependent Child or Spouse” in the employee signature block and submit to SCO for processing.

Court Ordered Dental Coverage – NATIONAL MEDICAL SUPPORT NOTICE – Notice to Withhold for Health Care Coverage
As noted previously, there may be a court order issued which will require a dental enrollment action. A support order known as a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) is now being used more frequently by the courts to provide coverage for dependent children.

Each NMSN contains specific instructions for both the employer and the employee, which must be followed. Orders of this type are generally subject to the dental program’s eligibility rules. However, the NMSNs are structured such that a personnel office may be required to administratively enroll an employee into a dental plan if the employee does not voluntarily enroll. NMSN orders are not contingent on whether employees decline or refuse to enroll themselves and their dependents into a dental plan.

The enrollment document (STD. 692) should be coded using enrollment code 01 (or code 04 for PI employees). Note in the remarks section: “Enrollment based on NMSN”. For PI employees, control period requirements for eligibility will still apply. For departments receiving a NMSN for an employee, who is currently enrolled in the FlexElect or CoBen Cash Option, the employee must continue the cash option enrollment unless the employee has experienced a permitting event (e.g., loss of other coverage) to allow cancellation.

The effective date of the enrollment will be the first of the following month after the order is received in the personnel office.

Including children added to group coverage under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order. This is a judgment, decree, or order that requires that a child receive benefits under group coverage regardless of his/her status as a dependent of the covered employee.

Employees Currently Not Enrolled (Excluding Bargaining Units 5 and 6)
If the dependent(s) covered in the NMSN is within the State of California and able to see the same dental provider as the employee, and the employee is willing to make a voluntarily enrollment of him/herself and the dependent(s) to comply with the NMSN, the employee may choose a state-sponsored prepaid plan.

If any of the dependents covered in the NMSN are outside the State of California, and the employee is willing to voluntarily enroll the dependent(s), the employee only has the option of enrolling in either the Delta PPO plus Premier or the Delta PPO.

If the personnel office must enroll the employee and dependent(s) administratively, the personnel office should enroll the employee and dependent(s) in the state-sponsored Delta dental plan.

Employees Currently Enrolled (Excluding Units 5 and 6)
If the employee is already enrolled in a prepaid dental plan, and the dependent(s) covered in the NMSN is within the State of California and able to see the same dental provider as the employee, the employee may add the NMSN covered dependent(s) to his/her current prepaid plan. If all NMSN covered dependents cannot seek services from the same prepaid plan provider or if the NMSN covered dependent(s) resides out-of-state, an employee making a voluntary enrollment of the NMSN dependent(s) may choose between the state-sponsored Delta PPO plus Premier and the Delta PPO. If the personnel office must enroll the dependent(s) administratively and the dependent(s) is unable to see the same prepaid provider as the employee, the personnel office should change the employee’s enrollment (now with dependents) into the state-sponsored Delta Dental plan.

When enrollment of dependents onto an employee’s existing dental benefits occurs through the authority of a NMSN, and there is no need for the personnel office to administratively change employee’s dental plan based on the coverage requirements created by the NMSN, the personnel office should use Permitting Event Code 16 (change of custody) to add the dependent(s).

Employees in Units 5 or 6
For employees in Bargaining Units (BU) 5 or 6, all the conditions stated above apply. For BU 5 employees enrolled in the CAHP Blue Cross dental plan, and Unit 6 employees enrolled in one of the CCPOA benefit trust dental plans, the respective benefit trust must be notified of the NMSN, with a copy of the NMSN sent to the benefit trust administrator, along with a copy of the enrollment document (STD. 692).

A move-out-of-household event is not currently considered a COBRA qualifying event, COBRA is not offered. However, personnel offices should send the person or persons being deleted off the employee’s dental plan under this event, notice of the cancelation of benefits. Attachment K – Notice of Loss of Employer Sponsored Coverage | Attachment K – Notice of Loss of Employer Sponsored Coverage – Text Only (RTF) can be used by personnel offices as a template for this notification. This notification would be sent to the last address on record of your employee taking the action to delete the dependent(s), but addressed to the person(s) being deleted. Consider that further action may be necessary if your office receives a court order to place the dependent(s) back on the employee’s plan prior to the finalization of legal action (divorce or separation). Personnel offices may, at the time your employee is taking this action to delete a dependent(s), ask whether there is a pending divorce or legal separation.

Eligible employees appointed permanent, LT or TAU with a time base of half-time or more and six months or more, have 60 days from the effective date of their appointment to complete and submit a STD. 692 form to their departmental personnel office. It is the department’s responsibility to advise each employee of the 60-day enrollment time limitation and to ensure that employees are provided information on the dental plans available. Eligible employees, who do not wish to enroll in a dental plan within the 60-day limit, must be advised that they will not be able to enroll until the next open enrollment period. These employees must complete Section D, and sign/date the STD. 692. This document, declining coverage, should be retained in the employee’s personnel file. No further action is required by the department. Do not submit documents declining enrollment to SCO or CalHR.

Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Employees
A PI employee who meets the eligibility criteria described in Section 505 may enroll in a state-sponsored dental plan. The earliest possible effective dates of enrollment are August 1st or February 1st, based upon the end of the control period, ending June 30th or December 31st. Completed STD. 692 enrollment forms must be submitted to the employing office, within 60 calendar days after the end of the control period.

PI Employees – CCPOA – Unit 6 Cadet Employees
Unit 6 cadet PI employees will be eligible for dental benefits following graduation from the Academy of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

For enrollment, use PEC 04.

Continuation of Coverage for PI Employees
Eligibility for a PI employee to continue enrollment is based upon qualification at the end of the next control period. To continue enrollment, a PI employee must receive credit for 480 paid hours in the current control period or a total of 960 paid hours in two consecutive (prior and current) control periods. If the employee does not qualify, coverage must be cancelled effective August 1, or February 1, depending on the non-qualifying control period.

An eligible PI employee has 60 days after the end of the qualifying control period to complete and sign a STD. 692 and submit it to the personnel office. A PI employee cannot enroll during an open enrollment period unless the open enrollment period corresponds with the completion of a control period and a portion of the 60-day time limit. However, a PI employee enrolled in a dental plan may only add/delete dependents and/or change dental plans during an open enrollment period.

Retired state employees that reinstate as a PI employee and have dental coverage, may reenroll within 60 days after appointment, and do not have to wait until the end of the qualifying control period. However, if the employee does not qualify, coverage must be cancelled effective August 1, or February 1, depending on the non-qualifying control period.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual

It is the responsibility of each department to inform employees of the requirements for making changes to their dental enrollment. The rules governing the changes listed below vary in time limits, therefore, employees should be advised to report changes to their personnel office as soon as possible after the event occurs. This means the event must occur first before the employee can file a change to their dental plan.

Mandatory Deletions
Dependents must be deleted as follows:

Divorced spouse must be deleted from coverage even if the divorce settlement requires the employee to provide dental coverage for the spouse. The state is not required to provide coverage for an ex-spouse. However, COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) must be offered.
Termination of a Domestic Partnership. (Employee must provide copy of notice of termination of the domestic partnership to the personnel office and COBRA must be offered to the terminated domestic partner.)

Retroactive processing is limited to six months for reimbursement of dental premiums for mandatory cancellations and/or deletions to employees’ dental coverage. Please refer to Human Resources Manual, Section 1403.

The employee may seek financial remedy by filing a governmental claim with the Department of General Services against their department for the amount of money they believe they did not receive. For additional information regarding the filing of a governmental claim, please visit  File-a-Government-Claim.

Voluntary Changes
Employees may elect to make any of the following changes to their enrollment:

Adding a newly acquired spouse, certified domestic partner and/or stepchild.
Adding a newborn, adopted child, or child at each birthday through the age of 6.
Adding spouse, certified domestic partner, or dependents that lost coverage. (Must provide proof of loss of coverage – keep in employee’s personnel file).
Adding a dependent due to a change in custody or acquiring an economically dependent child.
Deleting a dependent who obtains other group coverage (non-state sponsored).
Voluntary additions/deletions not initiated by the employee within 60 days from the Permitting Event Date may be processed only during a subsequent open enrollment period.

Administrative Deletions
The following deletions are processed administratively. The department is responsible for notifying the employee of administrative deletions. An employee signature is not required; enter “Administrative Deletion” on the Employee Signature line of the STD. 692.

Dependents who reach age 26 and are not disabled.
Employees and/or dependents enrolled but not eligible or dual/split coverage exists. Delete retroactive to the effective date using PEC 42. The employee is responsible for any costs for dental services that were performed on themselves or any ineligible dependent.
Employees that are enrolled but not eligible and refuse to sign the STD. 692 to change dental plans due to bargaining unit change. Cancel retroactive to Permitting Event Date, which caused eligibility to terminate using PEC 42.
The employee must be notified regarding this change and will not be allowed to enroll in a dental plan until the next scheduled open enrollment.
Death of a spouse, domestic partner, or child upon receipt of a death certificate.
Voluntary Change of Dental Plan
An employee may only change enrollment from one dental plan to another under the following conditions:

During an open enrollment period.
Due to a physical move to an area that is not serviced by the current dental carrier; (PEC: 34).
Due to a physical move to an area where a dental plan was not previously available to the employee; or (PEC: 35).
Due to service plan cut in the employee’s service area and/or the employee’s current dental plan does not have a dental provider within a 50-mile radius of the employee’s residence. (PEC: 34) Attachment C – Permitting Events Code Chart
Changes in Collective Bargaining Designation (CBID) Units 5 or 6
Unit 5 – California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP): Unit 5 employees who are enrolled in the CAHP dental plan, Blue Cross, are automatically moved to the state-sponsored Delta plan when they move out of Unit 5. The effective date of the dental plan change is based on when the PAR document is keyed. CHP personnel office staff must complete a STD. 692 and forward a copy to Delta dental so it can update its records accordingly. Since SCO processes the plan change automatically, the STD. 692 is not sent to SCO. Those R05 employees who were enrolled in one of the state-sponsored prepaid plans will continue their enrollment but will be allowed to elect to change to Delta dental if eligible if they choose to do so. CHP personnel office staff are responsible for notifying employees of their options.
Unit 6 – California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA): When employees move in or out of Unit 6, a new STD. 692 must be completed to change the employees to the appropriate dental plan based on their new CBID, failure to do so may result in a loss of coverage. STD. 692 should be completed and forwarded to SCO using PEC 40 with a standard effective date.
Enhanced and Basic Dental Coverage – Automatic Conversion
Employees enrolled in either Delta plan or SafeGuard who move from represented to excluded or excluded to represented will automatically have their dental benefit coverage level changed to either the Basic or Enhanced level of coverage. The effective date of the new plan will be contingent upon when the Personnel Action Request is keyed.

Employees moving from represented to excluded will be automatically moved into the enhanced level of coverage effective the first day of the month following their first full month as an excluded employee. For example, if the CBID identifier change over to an excluded designation is effective March 7, coverage would be effective May 1, (April pay period, first full month as excluded). Because this change is processed automatically by SCO, departments are encouraged to process PAR documents as quickly as possible so that employees receive their correct level of dental benefit coverage. The SCO runs a program each month normally two days prior to the master payroll cutoff. Any changes not processed for the current master payroll cutoff will be processed during the next pay period.
Employees moving from an excluded to a represented classification will be automatically moved into the basic level of coverage effective the first day of the month following the change to represented. For example, if the CBID change to represented is effective March 4, coverage would be effective May 2, (April pay period).
Should a Unit 6 employee promote to an excluded classification with Unit 6 affiliation, that employee now has the option of remaining in CCPOA or enrolling in the Delta PPO plus Premier enhanced, Delta PPO plan or one of the state-sponsored prepaid plans. Because of this new option, if your employee chooses to enroll in one of the state-sponsored plans they must complete a new STD. 692.

Unit 6 employees are restricted to enrollment into one of the CCPOA Union Benefit Trust Plans available to them, in accordance with their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Should a Unit 6 employee promote to a supervisory classification, (S06, M06, C06, and E06) that employee has the option of enrolling into a state-Sponsored plan or enrolling into CCPOA Benefit Trust union-sponsored Primary Dental Plan.  Failure to disenroll after promotion to a supervisory classification will result in SCO automatically disenrolling the employee after 60 days from CCPOA Western Dental (SCO will send a notice to the personnel office). Employees will be identified by the SCO for automatic deletion by their CBID number (S06 or M06 designation). Personnel offices must continue to complete a STD. 692, indicating any plan change.

Represented employees in Unit 5 who are union members are unable to enroll in Delta. Their indemnity dental benefits are provided through their CAHP Union Trust Plan. The effective date of some actions may occur in accordance with bargaining unit MOU requirements.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dental Program,"512. Effective Dates
There are two types of effective date rules that are applied to all dental enrollment transactions: Mandatory and Standard. The type of permitting event determines which effective date rule should be applied. Events, such as loss of coverage, deletion of dependents due to death or marriage, etc., would normally necessitate immediate action and therefore the mandatory effective date rule would apply. Those events that do not require immediate action would come under the standard effective date rule, i.e., initial enrollment, deletion of dependent at age 18, etc.

Attachment C – Permitting Events Code Chart, lists the various dental permitting event codes as well as the respective effective date rule that should be applied.

Mandatory Effective Date Rule
First of the month following the permitting event that allows the action to occur.

Example: Event occurs any time during the month the effective date will be the first day of the month immediately following the event. Employee’s date of divorce is 10/23. The effective date is 11/1.
Standard Effective Date Rule
First of the month after the STD. 692 is completed and received by the employing department.

Example (1): Employee hired 07/14 and submits STD. 692 on 08/11. The effective date is 09/01.
Example (2): Spouse moves out of household 03/25 and employee submits STD. 692 on 04/02. The effective date is 05/01.
STD. 692 forms which are submitted to SCO and must be returned to the employing office due to incomplete or incorrect information will maintain the original effective date. Personnel office staff needs to be aware, however, that document processing problems will result in a delay in eligibility information being sent to the dental plans. Employees should be advised accordingly.
Retroactivity/Emergency Plan Change
Except when approved by CalHR Benefits division, retroactivity/emergency plan changes will not be allowed. Employees must be advised not to use their dental plan prior to the effective date shown on the STD. 692 enrollment document, signed by the authorized agency representative or date approved by CalHR. A brief memo along with the completed STD. 692 should be submitted to CalHR for review. CalHR can request other types of documentation to support an appeal.

Revolving Fund Checks
Since deductions are not taken from revolving fund checks, employees who receive a revolving fund salary check will not have dental eligibility established with their respective dental carrier until a regular salary warrant is issued by SCO. Personnel office staff should contact CalHR in instances when an employee receiving a revolving fund check requires emergency dental treatment either for self or an eligible dependent so CalHR can assist in verifying eligibility with the employee’s dental carrier.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dental Program,"513. Re-Enrollment of Employees
Reinstatement after Leave of Absence
Coverage in the same dental plan is automatically restored, effective the first of the month after the first pay warrant is issued by SCO, provided no cancellation was processed prior to, or during the leave of absence. However, if the employee cancelled coverage, the employee must wait until the next open enrollment period to re-enroll. In certain situations, if the employee is off pay status for more than one pay period, an enrollment document (STD. 692) may be required to re-enroll the employee when they return to pay status. Departments should check the monthly payroll register to see if the employee’s dental deduction is shown. If the deduction is not shown, it will be necessary to contact SCO.

Reinstatement after Appeal
SCO requires that a STD. 674, Payroll Adjustment Notice, (and STD. 692 and/or STD. 700), be submitted to reinstate an employee’s benefit deductions (dental and vision), if the employee is mandatorily reinstated after a termination/suspension and had his/her dental coverage terminated. The effective date can be current or retroactive, depending on the direction in the reinstatement stipulation. Coverage continues for an employee who separated from state service, but who is reinstated without a break in service of more than one pay period. The department should confirm that the proper dental deduction is shown on the employee’s first payroll warrant issued after reinstatement. If not shown, contact SCO for assistance to reinstate deductions. In certain non-mandatory reinstatements with a break of more than one pay period, the dental deduction may show on the employee’s warrant, and the personnel office should ensure that the employee is eligible for the coverage. If not eligible, a STD. 692 should be submitted to SCO to cancel dental and STD. 700 to cancel vision coverage.

Retired Annuitants
Retired annuitants who temporarily return to state employment are not eligible to enroll in a dental plan as active employees; their dental eligibility is established and maintained based on their retirement status through CalPERS.

A retired annuitant who cancels his/her retirement and permanently returns to state employment is eligible to enroll in a dental plan as an active employee based on his/her bargaining unit designation. A new STD. 692 will need to be submitted to SCO for enrollment.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dental Program,"514. Annual Open Enrollment Period
Open enrollment periods are scheduled annually during the month of September through mid-October. Departments will be notified of open enrollment procedures prior to each open enrollment period. Eligible employees may enroll in a dental plan, change plans, and add/delete dependents during an open enrollment period.

Permitting Event Codes
The following permitting event codes should be used when completing the STD. 692 during an open enrollment period:
03 – New enrollment
15 – Addition/Deletion of dependent(s) (may use one form)
28 – Change of dental plan
29 – Change of plan and addition/deletion of dependent(s) (may use one form)
41 – Cancelling health/dental to enroll in cash in lieu of benefits. Forms to SCO must be stapled together.

Employees Off Active Pay Status During Open Enrollment Period
Eligible employees, who are off active pay status during the entire open enrollment period, may contact their personnel office during the open enrollment period to make changes in their dental enrollment or may wait and make changes within 60 days after returning to active pay status.

Effective Dates
All correctly completed open enrollment documents that are submitted to the SCO within the prescribed time frames, will be effective January 1 of the following calendar year. CalHR will send a PML memo to departments prior to the scheduled open enrollment period which will contain document processing instructions.

Correcting Open Enrollment Documents
Corrective action is required when an error has been made by the department in completing the STD. 692 as follows:

For errors that do not pertain to a payroll deduction (i.e., name, age of dependent), photocopy the STD. 692, make the necessary corrections in red, indicate “CORRECTED COPY” in red across the top of the form, and submit it to the dental carrier. Do not send a copy to SCO or CalHR.

Cancel or Change Open Enrollment Documents
Employees enrolling or making changes to their dental coverage during the open enrollment period may cancel or change their election until the end of the open enrollment period. In the remarks section of the new STD. 692, indicate the type of action taken and attach a copy of the original form that was previously sent to SCO during the open enrollment period. Employees may not cancel or change a dental election after the end of the open enrollment period unless they experience a valid change in status.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dental Program,"515. Continuation of Coverage While Off Pay Status
Employees on non-pay status may elect to continue dental coverage by paying the total premium directly to the dental carrier. During the period of non-pay status, the state contribution towards the dental premium is not paid, therefore, employees must be advised that they can elect to continue their dental coverage through direct payment of the total premium to the dental carrier in order to maintain coverage.

The Dental Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 696)
The Dental Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 696) is used to enroll eligible employees in direct pay for dental benefits. The STD. 696 fill and print form can be located at the CalHR web site. The form can also be ordered through the Department of General Services, Office of State Publishing.

An employee who wishes to continue coverage while off pay status must complete a Dental Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 696) and forward the form directly to the carrier with a check or money order for the full three-month premium amount. The employee’s enrollment may not exceed the duration of the state’s contract or one year, whichever comes first. However, in the event of an approved extension to the leave of absence, the carrier will accept direct payments beyond the normal one-year period. For employees with an approved leave extension beyond one year, the employing department must notify the carrier that direct payment of premiums will be continuing beyond one-year. Also, another STD. 696 must be completed and submitted to the new carrier if there is a change in dental carriers at the end of the contract period. If an employee on direct pay has a status change, the employing office must complete a STD. 692 and submit the enrollment form to the SCO. SCO will manually update the payroll master file and upon the employee returning to work, the update will be in place.

An employee who does not elect direct payment must complete section B of the STD. 696, to decline continued coverage. If the employee elects not to enroll, he/she will be liable for any dental expenses incurred while off pay status. A copy should be retained in the employee’s personnel file. In this instance, do not send a copy of the STD. 696 to the dental carrier.

Instructions for the completion of the STD. 696 are printed on the reverse side of the form. Personnel staff should verify that all information is completed correctly. Do not forward the original document or copies of the STD. 696 to SCO or CalHR.

Absences/Situations Where Coverage Lapses
Leave of absence for one or more full pay periods other than NDI, IDL, 4800 Time or Workers Compensation with supplementation.
Appeal of involuntary termination (COBRA provisions apply, direct payment provisions are not applicable).
Suspension of one or more complete pay periods.
PI enrolled but off pay status (Reduction in hours -COBRA provisions apply, direct payment provisions are not applicable).
Application for disability retirement is pending (employee is off pay status).
Pending IDL determination when all sick leave and vacation credits have been exhausted (employee is off pay status).
Death of an employee (120-day death benefit applies; COBRA provisions are applicable after CalPERS’ determination of survivor benefits).
Under approved State Disability Insurance benefits.
Direct Payment of Premiums
Dental carriers do not send a monthly bill to an employee who elects to pay premiums directly while he/she is off pay status. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each employee to ensure premium payments are paid timely. Direct pay is normally limited to 12 months. However, in the event of an approved extension to the leave of absence, the carrier will accept direct payments beyond the normal one-year period.
Payments must be paid in advance and cover a minimum period of three months or the length of the absence whichever is less. The employee’s check/money order for the first three months must be attached to the newly completed STD. 696 and sent to the carrier.
The dental carrier must receive the initial payment by the first day of the month following the first full month the employee is off pay status. Subsequent installments and/or final payment are due to the dental carrier by the first of each subsequent three-month period. STD. 696 forms received by the dental carrier without the required payment attached will be returned to the employee. Failure to pay the required payment in a timely manner will result in the employee’s dental coverage being cancelled.
In the event an employee returns to pay status prior to the end of his/her approved leave of absence, it will be the employee’s responsibility to contact his/her dental carrier to request a refund of any direct premium overpayments paid.
Addition or Deletion of Family Members While on Non-Pay Status
An employee who has a permitting event occur while on non-pay status may make changes to his/her dental enrollment as indicated below:

An employee is responsible for contacting his/her personnel office and completing a new STD. 692 reflecting the enrollment change. The personnel office must forward the document to SCO for processing.
If an employee is on direct pay and the change results in a change of premium, a new STD. 696 must also be completed.
If an employee deletes any dependent prior to or during the leave, the dependent may not be re-enrolled until the next open enrollment period.
Return to Pay Status
Upon return to pay status (if an employee is still enrolled), the state premium contributions will commence with the first pay warrant issued by SCO.
The personnel office should check the employee’s pay warrant to verify that the dental plan name is reflected. If the dental deduction is not shown, contact SCO to establish.

Dental Benefits for Exempt Employees Separating from state Service
For exempt employees who are separating from state service, and have not reached retirement age, but desire to continue their dental benefits until they reach minimum retirement age, the conditions listed below will be applicable.

Conditions of Eligibility
Exempt employees who have at least ten (10) years of state service which includes at least two (2) years of credited service while an exempt employee, who permanently separate from state service on or after January 1, 1988, and at the time of separation have more than 10 years before they would attain their minimum age for service retirement from state service, may elect to continue or not continue their dental benefits until their date of retirement.

An exempt employee may elect to continue his/her dental benefits at the time of separation. The enrollment must be made within sixty (60) days from their date of permanent separation. The premium rate is 102 percent (%) of the current state rate. While this rate is the same as the COBRA rate, continuation of coverage in this instance is not part of COBRA.
Dental Plan Enrollment Form and Premium Payment
Should an exempt employee elect to continue dental benefits at the time of separation, the following information on enrollment procedures is being provided.

Indemnity Type and PPO Plans – Delta Dental
For enrollments in Delta or PPO, exempt employees should complete the “Std. 692 Dental Enrollment” form. The following statement should be written across the top of each form, “Based on Section 22815 of the Government Code”. The enrollment form and initial premium payment should be sent to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) for verification of eligibility. CalPERS will forward the enrollment form and initial payment to Delta for processing. The premiums must be paid on a quarterly schedule. After the initial enrollment, subsequent premiums are sent directly to Delta and due by the first day of the month that the quarter begins (January, April, July and October). Non-payment for two (2) consecutive quarters will automatically disqualify the enrollee from this program. To ensure that the quarterly premiums are credited properly, enrollees should write their social security number and group number 9949-8601 (Delta PPO plus Premier) or 9946-8601 on their payment check.

Prepaid Plans – DeltaCare USA, Premier Access, SafeGuard and Western Dental

The following statement should be written across the top of each form, “Based on Section 22815 of the Government Code”. The enrollment form and the initial payment should be sent to the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) to the attention of the Dental Coordinator, for verification of eligibility. CalHR will forward the enrollment form and initial payment to the dental carrier for processing.

The premiums will be paid on a monthly schedule. After the initial enrollment, subsequent premiums are sent directly to the carrier and due by the first day of each month (January, February, March, etc.). Non-payment for two (2) consecutive months will automatically disqualify the enrollee from this program. To ensure that the monthly premiums are credited properly, enrollees should write their social security numbers and “state exempt employee” on their payment check.

Separating Legislative Members
A former Member of the Legislature who has served six or more years as a member of the Legislature may elect, within 60 days after permanent separation from state service, to enroll or continue enrollment in a dental care plan as provided to state annuitants. Upon that election, the former member is required to pay the total premiums related to the coverage and an additional 2 percent for the administrative costs. Should the person electing this benefit subsequently terminate his or her coverage, they may not reenroll in accordance with Government Code Section 22811. Conditions of payment are the same as those separating from state service outlined in this section.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dental Program,"516. 120-Day Death Benefit for Continuation of Benefits
Under the 120-day death benefit, departments are required to continue to pay full premiums to continue coverage for a covered employee’s spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family members for 120 days following an employee’s death. The 120-day period is to provide the family a grace period while CalPERS determines if the spouse, domestic partner or other family members are eligible for a survivor’s benefit.

In implementing this benefit, departments will use the process used for an employee on an unpaid leave of absence (STD. 696). Under this process, the deceased employee’s department will pay four months of both the employer and employee contributions directly to the dental plans.

An eligible spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible dependent(s) who is determined to be an eligible survivor and receives a continuing allowance from CalPERS may continue dental coverage as annuitants.

If CalPERS determines that the spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family member(s) is not eligible for survivor benefits, then the department should notify the spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family member(s) of COBRA eligibility within sixty days from the date CalPERS makes this determination. Upon notice of COBRA eligibility by the department, it is the responsibility of the spouse, domestic partner, or other eligible family member(s) to elect and pay monthly premiums directly to the plan(s) in the manner prescribed in the COBRA Election Notice.

New enrollments or re-enrollments
Authorized changes to current coverage
Cancellation of all coverage
Elections not to enroll in a dental plan
COBRA continuation (Use STD. 692 for prepaid plans)
The completed STD. 692 is submitted to SCO within the prescribed time limit for normal processing. Do not use the STD. 692 to report any changes regarding the employee that are reported on a STD. 686, Employee Action Request.  These would include social security number, date of birth, name, address, or agency and unit changes.

Once an employee is enrolled, any corrections to a dependent name or date of birth should be noted in red on a photocopy of the most recent enrollment form and forwarded directly to the appropriate dental carrier. Do not send a copy to SCO or CalHR. An employee should report address changes directly to their carrier.

If any alterations are made to the wording in Section D of the STD. 692 by either the employee or the personnel staff, the SCO will not process the document and it will be returned to the department.

Attachment H – Instructions for Completion of Dental Plan Enrollment Authorization (STD 692) | Attachment H – Instructions for Completion of Dental Plan Enrollment Authorization (STD 692) – Text Only (RTF) provides a chart with instructions for the completion of each item on the STD. 692 for active, retired and COBRA enrollments. Refer to Attachment B – Dental Deduction Codes/Premiums for current dental rates information. Personnel office staff are encouraged to make use of these valuable reference tools.

2. Multiple Transactions
When the PEC, effective date, and Permitting Event Code are the same, all transactions can be reported on one form. When any of these items are different it will be necessary to complete a separate STD. 692 to report each change. When submitting more than one STD. 692, each form should be numbered (in remarks section) based on the sequence of each event (i.e., 1 of 3, 2 of 3 and 3 of 3).",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dental-program/,Benefits Administration Manual

The EOC booklets are also available for download at www.deltadentalins.com/state.  Delta Dental mails EOC booklets to newly enrolled, active employees and newly enrolled retirees directly to their home address.
Delta Dental: (800) 225-3368
Verification of Coverage
In the event an employee indicates that a dental claim for services has been denied, it is possible that there is a problem with the employee’s enrollment and the employee is not reflected on the dental carrier’s eligibility files. If this occurs, departments should do the following:
Verify that the correct dental plan name is reflected on the employee’s pay warrant.
Ensure that the claim denial was not prior to the 5th or the 20th of the month because the carriers receive eligibility information from SCO via electronic download on these dates. The employee may want to have his/her dentist resubmit the claim.
Confirm with the employee that the correct Social Security Number was entered on the claim form.
Review the file copy of the STD. 692 for accuracy.
If the STD. 692 is correct, contact the SCO Deductions Liaison Unit to verify when the document was processed and premiums paid.
If any of the following items are incorrect on the STD. 692, contact the SCO Deductions Liaison Unit:
Section A – Items 1, 2 or 4
Section B – Item 1; Item 3 does not correspond to Section E, Item 4
Section D – Form not signed/dated
Section E – Item 1; Item 2 does not correspond to Items 7 and 8 and/or Section B-1
Change of Dentist
Employees enrolled in a state-sponsored prepaid plan (DeltaCare USA, Premier Access, SafeGuard, Western Dental) are allowed to change to a different dentist within the dental plan’s provider network. This type of change must be done through the dental carrier. Please refer the employee appropriately.

Employee Complaints
All the dental carriers have an internal complaint/grievance process in the event an employee is not satisfied with the services or benefits he/she receives. An employee with such a complaint should be advised to contact his/her dental carrier directly.

In addition, all the dental carriers are required to be licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Act of 1975, which is now administered by the Department of Managed Health Care. An employee who has exhausted his/her dental carrier’s grievance/complaint process and is not satisfied with how the matter has been handled or resolved can contact the Department of Managed Health Care, Complaint Center or Hotline at (888) 466-2219.

Claim Forms
Claim forms are not required by DeltaCare USA or SafeGuard. Claim forms for Delta dental are generally not necessary because of direct claims submission by the provider to Delta dental. For out-of-network claims for reimbursement for services rendered by a non-Delta dental provider, claim forms may be obtained directly from Delta dental. Employees in Units 5 and 6 should contact their respective union for information on how to obtain claim forms.

Dependent Re-Verification,"Introduction
The Dependent Re-Verification Guide is designed to assist you and your department with your fiduciary responsibility of ensuring that only eligible dependents of employees are covered by state employer sponsored benefits.

This guide aims to increase your knowledge of the Dependent Re-Verification program to ensure compliance with laws and established policies and procedures.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dependent-re-verification/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dependent Re-Verification,"1.0 The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) Program
The DRV program was implemented as a cost mitigation strategy for state departments effective in 2018. In an effort to control rising health care costs, CalPERS conducted a Dependent Eligibility Verification (DEV) of its membership during fiscal year 2013-14 utilizing a vendor. The DEV required departmental personnel offices to verify the eligibility of employee dependents for continued enrollment in state-sponsored health benefits. The DEV efforts resulted in cancellations of 8,379 ineligible dependents enrolled in health and resulted in a savings of over $60 million by reducing future claims and employer contribution costs.

The success of the DEV led to the adoption of Senate Bill 98, Chapter 28, Statutes of 2015, adding Government Code (GC) Section 22843.1 to the Public Employees’ Medical & Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). GC 22843.1 implemented a permanent DRV process for departmental personnel offices, requiring departments to verify the continued eligibility of employee dependents for state-sponsored health benefits on a triennial basis and mandated CalHR to set the standards. On July 16, 2021, Assembly Bill 138, Chapter 78, Statutes of 2021, was signed into law, and the DRV authority was removed from PEMHCA and added to CalHR GC 19815.9.

Authority was given to CalHR to set the Dependent Re-verification (DRV) standards pursuant to GC 19815.9. In addition, Title 2, Section 599.855 of the California Code of Regulations clarifies and makes specific the above-mentioned statute for application by state departments.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dependent-re-verification/,Benefits Administration Manual
Dependent Re-Verification,"DRV Regulation
Government Code section 19815.9 mandates re-verifying the eligibility of family members for health benefits.

Government Code section 22959 authorizes extending this review to family members enrolled for dental benefits. The bargaining unit contracts specify that family member eligibility for dental benefits shall be the same as that prescribed for health benefits.

In addition, Government Code 19815.9 requires State employers to:

Verify the eligibility of all employees’ dependents prior to enrolling them in health, dental and/or vision benefits
Retain and maintain a record of the verifying documentation for each dependent
Validate/re-verify dependent eligibility at least once every three years for most dependents
Remove unverified and ineligible dependents from all benefits promptly
Why is this Important?
Sets necessary standards for state employees and departments and creates transparency and equity
A standardized re-verification process adds integrity to the employer sponsored state benefit programs
Helps curb the rising costs associated with medical benefits
Additionally, by taking the following steps, department personnel offices can help to keep costs in check by reducing future claims and state employer contributions for ineligible dependents.

Educate employees on their role and responsibility towards providing current and accurate demographic and dependent information
Educate employees on the definition of an eligible dependent for benefits purposes
Re-verify the continuing eligibility of dependents enrolled in health, dental and premier vision benefits
Promptly remove ineligible dependents from all benefits coverage
Maintain current employee demographic, dependent and benefits eligibility and enrollment information
Dependents Included in DRV

Each employee must submit a completed CalHR Form 781 along with all required re-verification document(s) by dependent type.  The DRV notices sent to the employee by CalHR and/or CalPERS will include a list of required documents for each dependent type as well important dates and other pertinent information.

Dependent Type	Required Re-verification Documents
Spouse or Domestic Partner	
A copy of employee’s government issued marriage certificate or domestic partnership registration filed with the California Secretary of State or a comparable agency in another jurisdiction AND one of the following financial documents:

A copy of the first page of the employee’s federal or state income tax return from the previous tax year such as IRS Form 1040 confirming dependent as the employee’s spouse or domestic partner

OR

Other reoccurring financial documentation, including but not limited to a household bill, account statement, or insurance policy listing the name and address of the employee and their spouse or domestic partner, or a combination of other documents that substantiate the existence of a current marriage or domestic partnership. Household bills and account statements older than 60 calendar days are unacceptable.

If the marriage certificate was registered prior to January 1, 1980, the marriage certificate does not need to indicate government issued.

Natural-born Children/ Adopted Children	A copy of the birth certificate or adoption certificate naming the employee as the parent
Stepchildren/ Domestic Partner Children up to age 26 (the month in which dependent attains age 26)	
A copy of the birth certificate naming employee’s current spouse or domestic partner as the parent

AND

Documentation of employee’s current relationship to their spouse or domestic partner (follow DRV requirements for spouse or domestic partner)

Reminder:

Department personnel offices are required to maintain all re-verification documents in each employee’s Official Personnel Files (OPF) without a purge date – Gov. Code 19815.9 (a).

 
 
 
Other Events Coinciding with the DRV Cycle
Children Reaching Age 26

Health Benefits:

If a child’s 26th birthdate coincides with the employee’s upcoming re-verification cycle, that child will not be included in the DRV process if the 26th birthday falls before the end of the re-verification cycle. CalPERS will administratively remove the child from health benefits upon the child turning age 26.

Dental and Premier Vision Benefits:

If a child’s 26th birthdate coincides with the employee’s upcoming re-verification cycle, that child will not be included in the DRV process if the 26th birthday falls before the end of the re-verification cycle. See the 26 Year Age Out Process section for more information on the steps the Department Personnel Offices must take.

Permissive Deletions (All Benefits)

Employees should contact their departmental personnel offices immediately if they wish to remove a dependent due to a “permissive qualifying event” (e.g., family member obtains non-state sponsored health benefits, family member enters military, custody change for child under age 18, or child reaches age 18). The dependent should be removed due to a qualifying permissive event rather than ineligibility found during the re-verification process.

Mandatory Deletions (All Benefits)

Employees should notify their departmental personnel offices immediately of any qualifying event that occurs during their re-verification period, such as divorce or termination of domestic partnership. In these situations, the dependent should be removed due to the qualifying event rather than ineligibility found during the re-verification.

Parent-Child Relationship (PCR) Dependent or Disabled Child Aged 26 and Over Recertification (All Benefits)

The DRV is separate from the process to recertify a PCR dependent annually or a disabled child aged 26 and over. If employees receive notices to recertify PCR dependents during their DRV cycle, they should follow the instructions on these notices to recertify PCR and disabled dependents.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dependent-re-verification/,Benefits Administration Manual

In February 2018, CalPERS started mailing DRV notices to employees with dependents enrolled in health benefits. Department Personnel Offices process health benefits DRV transactions in MyCalPERS.

The automated DRV process for dependents enrolled in health benefits started with the April 2018 birth month cycle with the 1st set of notifications mailed in February 2018.

Employees enrolling family members in health benefits within six months of their birth month will re-verify their eligibility during the next cycle.  Example:  An employee with the October birth month enrolls a spouse in July 2021.  The eligibility of this spouse will be re-verified in 2024.

Note: This six-month exclusion rule doesn’t apply to the dental and/or premier vision re-verification process.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/dependent-re-verification/,Benefits Administration Manual

If an employee does not provide all required documents timely, department personnel offices are to administratively disenroll unverified dependent(s) from dental and/or premier vision benefits effective the first of the month following the employee’s birth month/cycle year.

Department personnel offices must follow already established processes through SCO to remove dependents from dental and/or premier vision benefits

Within 30 days of removing ineligible/unverified dependents from dental and/or premier vision benefits, department personnel offices are required to inform the employee in writing, listing the dependent name(s) that are disenrolled and the effective date of the disenrollment
The department personnel offices are also required to provide COBRA information to the family members within 30 days from their loss of coverage

If an employee provides re-verification documents for eligible dependent(s) after the last day of the employee’s birth month, department personnel offices may re-verify and re-enroll the dependent(s) prospectively effective the 1st of the month following receipt of all required DRV documents. The HIPAA 90 day waiting period does not apply to DRV re-enrollments.

Example:

Employee’s birth month is March and is subject to the March 2023 DRV cycle

All required DRV documents are due by March 31, 2023

Employee submits DRV documents on April 5, 2023

Dependent(s) can be re-verified and re-enrolled effective May 1, 2023

Since removal of unverified dependents from dental and premier vision benefits is not automated, department personnel offices must first disenroll and then re-enroll the dependent(s) prospectively for dental and/or premier vision benefits.

Employees should contact their departmental personnel offices with questions regarding the DRV program.  If the employee disagrees with their departmental personnel office’s decision on the re-verification of their family members, they must submit their reasoning for disagreement, in writing, to their departmental contact. These disagreements can be viewed as an employee’s DRV appeal. DRV Appeals typically involve:

Request to retroactively re-verify and re-enroll deleted dependent(s)
Refund of access premium paid for dependent(s) deleted through the DRV process
Cancellation of A/Rs for retroactive re-verification enrollments
Extenuating circumstances during DRV cycle
Department personnel offices are responsible to review each appeal and request all supporting documents from the employee in order to make a determination on whether the appeal should be approved or denied based on regulation, policies and procedures.

The appeal and the department’s determination must be reviewed and approved by a personnel office supervisor and discussed with the employee.  If the appeal involves a request for an exception to the established DRV policies and procedures, then the department must submit and appeal packet to CalHR’s DRV Unit for a final determination and next steps.

The DRV appeal packet must include a completed and signed DRV Appeals Intake Form (CalHR-277) and the following (if applicable):

Supporting documents
For Extenuating circumstances during DRV cycle: If an employee state that they were unable to submit their DRV documents within time limits prescribed due to a cause beyond their control, such as a death, being out of the country, natural disaster, being incarcerated, etc., they must provide documentation supporting the situation and those document(s) must be submitted with the employee’s appeal to the DRV Unit
For refunds and/or cancelation of A/Rs, include impacted pay periods and monthly deduction amounts

Employee Assistance Program (EAP),"601. General Information
The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) was established in March 1982 by Executive Order B96-82. At that time, the Department of Personnel Administration, now California Department of Human Resources (CalHR), assumed responsibility for the Program. EAP was established to assist employees and their family members in identifying and gaining control over personal problems which can, and often do, affect both family life and job performance. Through direct counseling and/or referrals, EAP counselors can assist employees in addressing family or marital difficulties, problems with alcohol or drugs, and feelings of stress or depression. Counseling and/or referrals to community resources is also available for financial matters, child and elder care issues, and legal matters.

CalHR’s Benefits Division, currently maintains the master agreement with Magellan Healthcare to provide services for any State department that wishes to participate. Departments not participating under the master agreement with Magellan Healthcare  must provide their employees’ with assessment and referral services under an internal program.

An eligible dependent is defined as an employee’s legally married spouse or registered domestic partner and any unmarried children under 23 years of age (age 26 effective 7/1/2020). Eligible children include natural children, legally adopted children, stepchildren, and children for whom the employee is the legal guardian or who live with the employee in a regular parent/child relationship and are economically dependent upon the employee. If any unmarried child, who upon attaining age 23 (age 26 effective 7/1/2020), is incapable of self-support because of physical disability or mental incapacity and is dependent on the eligible employee for support and care, he/she shall continue to be considered a dependent under this definition, provided that proof of such incapacity is provided to the contractor.

Employee Assistance Program (EAP),"609. Referrals
There are three ways that EAP services may be accessed:

Self-Referral
This type of referral occurs as a result of an employee recognizing a problem in either his/her own or a dependent’s life. As a result of this recognition, the employee and/or dependent may contact the service provider for assessment, short-term counseling, and possible referral.

Informal Referral (Supervisor Recommendation)
This type of referral occurs when a supervisor wants to help an employee whom the supervisor senses is struggling with a personal problem; or perhaps an employee has asked a supervisor for help in solving a problem. The supervisor can play a key role in helping the employee get immediate assistance by suggesting that he/she use EAP.

Formal Supervisor Referral
A formal referral is utilized when there is no improvement in an employee’s work performance or other areas of deficiency which were discussed in their informal corrective meeting.  A supervisor will talk directly with a Magellan Workplace Support Consultant (WPS) by calling 1-866-EAP-4SOC (1-866-327-4762).  The WPS consultant will advise the supervisor of the best way to approach the employee regarding EAP.  In addition, the consultant will provide guidance to help the supervisor prepare a formal letter to be given to the employee to address  the stated problem, and to review management’s expectations.

A Supervisor’s Handbook is available from the departmental EAP Coordinator.

FlexElect Program,"702. Plan Options
The options available under FlexElect are:

Cash Option
Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan and must certify they have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source (see eligibility restrictions Section 704, Eligibility for FlexElect).

Group coverage is typically maintained by an employer or employee organization and must conform to the federal Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) minimum value standards.  The ACA establishes a minimum value standard of benefits for a health plan.  For a qualifying group health plan to meet the ACA’s minimum value standards, the plan must cover at least 60 percent of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan.  Employees may refer to their plan’s Summary of Benefits and Coverage document to determine if their coverage meets the law’s minimum value standards.

All CalPERS-sponsored health plans meet the minimum value standards.  Employees covered under individual coverage, such as TRICARE, Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Covered California are not eligible for the FlexElect Cash Option, even if they meet the minimum value standards.

Cash Option payments are taxable and the amounts are listed below:

$128 per month in lieu of medical insurance
$12 per month in lieu of dental insurance
$140 per month in lieu of health and dental insurance
Employees, except permanent intermittent (PI) employees, who are currently enrolled in the Cash Option will be automatically reenrolled into the Cash Option for the next FlexElect Plan Year. Therefore, these employees are not required to complete a Cash Option Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701C) during the annual FlexElect Open Enrollment Period unless they wish to cancel or change their Cash Option enrollment. PI employees are required to reenroll (complete a new STD. 701C) for each year they wish to receive the Cash Option.

Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) governing the FlexElect Program, employees who complete a form to enroll in FlexElect during the annual FlexElect Open Enrollment Period have until December 31 of the same year, to cancel or change their FlexElect Open Enrollment elections (for the next plan year). This rule also applies to employees who are automatically reenrolled in the Cash Option. Accordingly, if employees wish to cancel or change their automatic Cash Option reenrollment after the open enrollment period, they may do so no later than December 31 (prior to the new plan year).

Employees who are not enrolled in the Cash Option and wish to enroll for the next FlexElect Plan Year, must complete a STD. 701C during the current FlexElect Open Enrollment Period.

Dental Cash Option Three-Year Commitment
Once enrolled in the Dental Cash Option, the employee is obligated to stay in the Dental Cash Option for three plan years. After completion of the three plan year commitment, employees may enroll in a state dental plan during the next open enrollment period. The Personnel Office should take steps to monitor the three-year commitment and ensure compliance when employees request cash option enrollments or changes during or after the open enrollment period.

Exception to the three-year commitment: If employees lose their other dental coverage, they have 60 days (after the loss of coverage) to cancel the dental cash and reenroll into a state-sponsored dental plan. If this action is not requested within the 60-day period, employees must wait until the next open enrollment period to cancel the cash and reenroll into a dental plan.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA)
Employees may authorize a monthly deduction to be placed into a MRA to reimburse themselves for eligible medical expenses. The deduction is taken from the employees’ paychecks before federal, state, and social security taxes are assessed. The minimum contribution into the account is $10 per month; the annual maximum may vary year to year. Employees who enroll mid-year can still contribute the annual maximum and would not be subject to the monthly maximum. Employees may not request reimbursement from this account to pay for any out-of-pocket premium costs for their medical and/or dental insurance. Employees may reference the FlexElect Handbook which provides a partial list of expenses that are payable under the state’s FlexElect MRA.

FlexElect Program,"Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA)
Employees may authorize a monthly deduction to be placed into a DCRA to reimburse themselves for expenses for eligible child care, elder care, and care for a disabled dependent. The deduction is taken from the employees’ paychecks before federal, state, and social security taxes are assessed. The minimum contribution into the account is $20 per month; the annual maximum is $5,000 per year (per household) or $2,500 for married, filing a separate income tax return. (Over a 12-month period, the monthly maximum is $416.66.) Employees who enroll mid-year can still contribute the annual maximum. In this situation, the monthly maximum deduction would not be limited to $416.66. In any case, the annual contribution cannot exceed the lesser of (a) the applicable maximum amount, or (b) the employee’s annual earned income, or (c) the annual earned income of the employee’s spouse. If employees need help determining whether their expenses qualify for reimbursement, check IRS Publication 503.

Annual Reenrollment Requirement: Employees enrolled in the MRA and/or the DCRA MUST REENROLL in FlexElect during the annual open enrollment period each year they wish to participate by completing a Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R). There is no automatic reenrollment into either of the reimbursement accounts. Under the Internal Revenue Code governing the FlexElect Program, employees who enroll/reenroll into a MRA and/or DCRA during the annual FlexElect Open Enrollment Period, have until December 31 (of the same year), to cancel or change their FlexElect elections (for the next plan year).

Administrative Fee
Employees enrolled in the Cash Option and/or a MRA/DCRA pay a monthly $1.00 administrative fee. This fee is determined by CalHR and will be deducted from the participant’s after tax salary each month.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"703. Premium Only Plan (POP)
Under the State’s Premium Only Plan (POP) any out-of-pocket premium cost to employees for their State-sponsored health/dental insurance is taken out of their paycheck before federal, state, and social security taxes are deducted. This tax savings helps to offset some of their insurance premium cost. As the insurance premiums increase or decrease, the employees’ share will automatically change and continue to be deducted from their paycheck as long as they are enrolled in POP.

Enrollment into POP
All employees who pay an out-of-pocket share for their State-sponsored health/dental premiums are automatically enrolled into POP. POP participants are not subject to the FlexElect administrative fee unless they are also enrolled in the FlexElect Cash Option and/or either of the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts.

Disenrollment Process
For the vast majority of employees, the tax savings provided in the POP clearly outweigh any negative impact. In some cases, however, certain employees or those employees close to retirement who are concerned with the potential loss in social security benefits may choose not to be enrolled in POP.  Some employees are concerned that participating in POP will result in some loss of social security earned quarters. Employees should be advised there is no impact to the social security quarters they earn by participating in POP. The potential loss of social security benefits increases each year that employees continue to participate in POP because there is no social security deducted from their share of out-of-pocket health/dental premiums. However, it should be noted, it would take many years of continued participation in POP before the social security benefits lost exceeded the tax savings realized each month.  Employees concerned about either the low income impact or their social security benefits should be advised to seek the advice of a qualified tax consultant.  Employees have 60 days from the date they first become eligible for POP to disenroll. Thereafter, all POP enrollees may disenroll each year during the annual open enrollment period by completing Attachment G – Premium Only Plan (POP) Disenrollment Form (CalHR 006).

Disenrollment Restriction
Employees who may not disenroll from POP are:

Employees enrolled in the FlexElect Program, as the pre-tax benefit is part of their FlexElect election and participation and;
Employees enrolled in the Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) Program.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program

Prior to enrolling a PI employee in FlexElect, please read this information carefully.
Unit 6 employees may use any of the options within FlexElect except the Cash Option in lieu of their dental insurance. This requirement is per the union’s Benefit Trust restriction.
Employees who are maintaining their own coverage on any state-sponsored health and/or dental benefits (including the CSU system) ARE NOT eligible for the Cash Option.
Units 2, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and excluded employees are in the Consolidated Benefits (CoBen) Program. These employees are eligible for the CoBen Cash Option and therefore, are not eligible for the FlexElect Cash Option. Eligible employees enrolled in CoBen may enroll in the FlexElect Program Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA) and/or Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA).
Employees who are eligible to receive the survivor benefits after the death of a spouse or domestic partner can newly enroll or continue to receive the FlexElect Cash.
Loss of Eligibility
Employees lose eligibility for FlexElect when they:

Change  to a time base that is less than half-time;
Change to an appointment that is not permanent (such as LT or TAU) unless the employee has a mandatory right of return to a permanent position with a time base that is half-time or more;
Change to a Permanent Intermittent (PI) position (may possibly re-enroll as a newly eligible PI). Please see Section 710, Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Enrollment, for PI enrollment information and eligibility requirements.
Personnel Office Responsibility When Employee Loses Eligibility
When an employee loses eligibility for FlexElect due to one of the above events, his/her enrollment must be cancelled. The effective date of cancellation must be the first of the second month following the date of the event (the date of time-base/appointment change). For example, an employee enrolled in the Cash Option transfers to a PI position effective July 14th. The Cash Option enrollment must be cancelled effective September 1.

Cancellation of FlexElect enrollment due to a loss of eligibility (as shown above) may be processed administratively.
The department is responsible for notifying the employee when an administrative FlexElect cancellation is done. The department should indicate the following information on the form(s) and submit to SCO for processing:

Effective Date: 1st of the second month following the date of event.
Permitting Event Date: Date of time base and/or appointment change.

FlexElect enrollment choices are in effect for the entire plan year, January 1 through December 31. Employees may not change or cancel their FlexElect elections during the plan year, except for permitting events as defined by IRS regulations. IRS regulations also require that any changes/cancellations to FlexElect benefit elections must be necessary and appropriate as a result of the change in status event. Once an election is made (after a newly eligible permitting event), the employee must experience another permitting event to change their election, even if they are still within the 60-day time period.

2021 Plan Year Relief under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and IRS Notice 2021-15

MRA and DCRA participants will be allowed to make a one-time prospective election change per account during the 2021 plan year without a permitting event. This has been added as Permitting Event Code 43. More information can be found under the 2020 and 2021 Employee Relief under the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts Program.

In general, permitting events include:
Marriage, divorce, legal separation, or annulment.
Birth or adoption of a child.
Death of a spouse, domestic partner, or dependent.
Loss or commencement of spouse’s or domestic partner’s employment or loss of spouse’s or domestic partner’s medical or dental coverage due to an employment status change.
Change in employee’s, spouse’s, or domestic partner’s work schedule (e.g., Family Medical Leave Act, Non-Industrial Disability Insurance, State Disability Insurance, Industrial Disability Leave, time-base change that results in a loss or gain of eligibility and coverage, commencement or return from an unpaid leave of absence).
Loss or commencement of dependent’s eligibility for medical coverage under the employee’s health insurance plan.
Change in place of residence or worksite of the employee, spouse, domestic partner, or dependent.
Change in dependent care provider and/or provider dependent care cost.​
The FlexElect Appendix A – Permitting Event Codes/Date Chart​  provides a list of permitting events, permitting event codes, and effective date information. The Permitting Event Chart reflects newly eligible enrollment information and those actions allowed as a result of a valid change in status event. Please note employees must submit their request (to enroll, cancel, or change) to their department within 60 days from the date the change in status event occurs. Requests submitted to the department after the 60 day time frame will not be processed.

Court Ordered Health/Dental Coverage which Impacts Flex/CoBen Cash
Occasionally an employee receiving Flex/CoBen Cash will be issued a court order regarding the provision of benefits for their dependent(s). The court order will specify the dependent be enrolled into benefits. The employee receiving Flex/CoBen Cash must be covered elsewhere for health and/or dental benefits and the dependent(s) should be added to those benefits to comply with the court order.

The company Application Software, Inc. (ASI) is the State’s contracted Third Party Administrator (TPA) and record keeper for the FlexElect Program Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA) and Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA). Employees must complete Attachment H – FlexElect Reimbursement Claim Form (CalHR 351) in order to receive reimbursement from their account.

ASI will process all reimbursement account claims. Once completed, the original copy of the form must be submitted to ASI along with appropriate documentation (e.g., receipt, doctor’s statement, itemized bill) to substantiate their medical or dependent care expenses in order to be reimbursed. A copy should be retained by the employee.

Employees enrolled in a DCRA may have their daycare provider sign the statement on the front of the CalHR 351, certifying the services were provided, in lieu of attaching a receipt. The daycare provider’s tax I.D. or social security number must also be included on the reimbursement claim form.

In December, all participants who elected to enroll or reenroll into a MRA and/or a DCRA for the next plan year will receive a supply of Reimbursement Claim Forms. After completion of the claim form, it should be mailed or faxed along with supportive documentation to:

AS
IFlex
P.O. Box 6044
Columbia, MO 65205-6044
FAX NUMBER: (877) 879-9038

FlexElect Program,"Period of Coverage for Reimbursement
IRS Codes stipulate eligible expenses, for purposes of the reimbursement accounts, must be for services/supplies received/purchased between the effective date of participation through December 31 of the same plan year. The effective date of participation is the effective date of enrollment (i.e., January 1 for those enrolling during the Open Enrollment period). If a participant is enrolled in the Medical Reimbursement Account and cancels his/her coverage before December 31, he/she may only submit claims for expenses incurred during the months for which they have contributed.

2020 and 2021 Plan Year Relief under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and IRS Notice 2021-15

Employees who canceled their Medical Reimbursement Account in 2020, or will cancel their Medical Reimbursement Accounts in 2021, will be eligible to incur expenses after their cancellation date and through the grace period. In no event will an employee be eligible for reimbursements exceeding the amount they contributed for the plan year. Dependent Care Reimbursement Account participants are already eligible to continue to incur expenses through the grace period. More information can be found under the 2020 and 2021 Employee Relief under the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts Program.

Employees may get confused about when they can start claiming expenses because even though January 1 is the start of the new plan year, reimbursement account deductions begin with the December pay period paycheck and continue through the following November pay period paycheck. This is because the December wages are dated January 1 (of the following year) and are considered earnings for the next tax year.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"Submission of Reimbursement Claim Forms

Employees who are enrolled in both a MRA and DCRA may request reimbursement from both accounts on one form by completing the appropriate sections. However, they will receive two reimbursement checks, one for each type of account.

If employees are submitting reimbursement claims for two separate plan years, they must use two separate claim forms to ensure reimbursement is made from the correct plan year account.

Processing Time for Reimbursement Claims
Beginning on January 1, 2015, Reimbursement Account claims are paid twice weekly.  The time between submission of a claim and the issuance of the check is two weeks.  Payments for the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account claims require the funds be available in the participants’ account and the service period has passed before issuance of a check.

If a claim is submitted for less than $10, the payment will be held until the total reimbursement equals $10 or more.  If there is less than $10 in the account, the Third Party Administrator will run a report twice a year in June and December, to identify those claims and pay them.

Final Claim Submission Deadline
The last possible date employees may submit claims for reimbursement from their Medical Reimbursement Act (MRA) and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Act (DCRA) is June 30 of the year following their participation in FlexElect. This means employees have six full months after the plan year has ended to submit their claims for expenses incurred during the plan year for which they were enrolled. If a claim is not postmarked by June 30 (or the next working day if June 30 falls on a weekend or holiday) the claim will not be processed and will be returned to the employee.

2020 and 2021 Plan Year Relief under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and IRS Notice 2021-15

The claims filing deadlines will also be extended due to the grace period extensions. These deadlines will be extended to June 30 of the following year. More information can be found under the 2020 and 2021 Employee Relief under the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts Program.

Reimbursement checks are mailed directly to the employees’ homes using address information on file with State Controller’s Office (SCO). Direct Deposit became available January 1, 2015, and participants can enroll by going to ASI’s website, then click on “Resources,” then click on “Forms” and then click on “Paperless Notification & Payment Authorization Form” or click on “Direct Deposit & Email/Text notification” under “Go Green” at the bottom of the page  Employees should be reminded to verify the address information on file with SCO through their department and to complete an “Employee Action Request” (EAR) Form (STD. 686) if the address is not correct. The third-party administrator (record keeper) is sent updated address information by SCO twice monthly on the 1st and the 15th. Depending on when the EAR is processed the record keeper will update its address files accordingly.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"​Extension of Benefits for 2 1/2 Months into the Next Plan Year
 

If the participants’ reimbursement account is active on December 31, the IRS rules on deferred compensation allow payment for medical and dependent care expenses incurred up to two and one-half months after the end of the plan year. In other words, employees may use money deducted during one plan year to pay for medical and dependent care expenses incurred up to March 15th of the following year. Employees still have until June 30th of the following year to claim expenses incurred up to March 15th and any unused amount at that time will be forfeited pursuant to IRS Rules.

Claims will be paid in the order in which they are received. If the employee has an account balance in their prior plan year’s account, and a claim is received with a date of service during the grace period, the expense will automatically be paid from their prior plan year’s account. If a claim is received at a later date, with a date of service in the prior plan year, and all the funds have been paid from their prior plan year account, the claim will not be paid.

For this reason, it is important that the employee file claims in the order expenses are incurred. This will help to assure they maximize the use of their account for both plan years.

If the participant cancels their Dependent Care or Medical Reimbursement Account during the plan year, or if they leave state service or retire and do not continue their MRA deduction via Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), they are not eligible to receive payment for services during the Grace Period (through March 15 of the following year).

2020 and 2021 Plan Year Relief under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and IRS Notice 2021-15

The grace period will be extended under the 2020 and 2021 plan years for both the Medical Reimbursement Accounts and Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts until December 31 of the following year. This will allow employees to continue to incur expenses and utilize funds remaining in their accounts. More information can be found under the 2020 and 2021 Employee Relief under the FlexElect Reimbursement Accounts Program.

Medical Reimbursement Account
IRS regulations require the state to make the full annual contribution amount available from the Medical Reimbursement Account. As a result, employees who incur eligible medical expenses can be reimbursed at any time during the plan year based on their annual contribution amount even though all of their monthly payroll deductions have not been taken.

For example, an employee enrolls in FlexElect and authorizes a monthly deduction of $100 (annual contribution of $1,200) into an MRA. This employee could incur an eligible expense in the amount of $2,000 in March, and submit a claim form along with a copy of the receipt for the $2,000 medical expense. The State would be required to pay the employee $1,200 (the annual maximum contribution) in March regardless of the fact the employee had only contributed $300 into his/her account (deductions from the December, January, and February pay period paychecks at $100 per month). The remaining deductions (March through November pay periods) would basically pay back his/her MRA.

FlexElect Program,"707. Enrollment Appeal Process
Under the policies and procedures of the FlexElect Program there are established timeframes for the completion and processing of enrollment forms. The department is responsible for ensuring that FlexElect Program information is provided to all employees and timely submission of enrollment forms. In situations when there has been a discrepancy in form processing, CalHR will consider an enrollment/change appeal, upon request.

Appeals for consideration must be sent to CalHR in one of the following ways:

E-mail:  flexelect@calhr.ca.gov
Fax:  855-629-7814
Or
Mail/hand deliver:  California Department of Human Resources
Benefits Division – FlexElect Program
1515 “S” Street, North Building, Suite 500
Sacramento, CA 95811-7258
​​​
Following are some situations that typically occur with enrollments and should be used as a guide prior to submitting any appeal for enrollment to CalHR for consideration:
​
1. Employee claims to have not been informed of the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period and wishes to enroll after October 12 but prior to January 1.
Employee will not be able to enroll unless the department certifies in writing that the employee was not notified of the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period and provides an explanation as to the reason. The department must send the FlexElect enrollment form and all other necessary forms to CalHR , Benefits Division for consideration. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

2. Employee claims to have not been informed of the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period and wishes to enroll after January 1.

Employee will not be able to enroll unless the department certifies in writing the employee was not notified of the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period and provides an explanation as to the reason. The department must send the FlexElect enrollment form and all other necessary forms to CalHR , Benefits Division for consideration. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

3. Employee submitted an incorrectly completed form. Errors were not detected by the department  which resulted in the form being rejected by SCO and returned.

Departments may submit a written explanation of the facts in cases where they believe they caused processing delays by making an error or not catching errors the employee made in completing the form. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

4. Employee submitted a correctly completed FlexElect enrollment form, however, the department did not submit the form to SCO in a timely manner and the deduction did not take effect.

Departments must submit an explanation in writing as to why the documents did not get processed timely to the CalHR , Benefits Division with all necessary enrollment forms. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

5. Employee submitted a correctly completed FlexElect enrollment form and the department forwarded the form to SCO in a timely manner. SCO did not receive the form and the request was not processed.

Departments must submit an explanation in writing certifying the form was forwarded to SCO in a timely manner but was not received/processed. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

6. Employee loses coverage and does not file 701C within 60 days from permitting event date.

Departments must submit an explanation in writing along with the HBD-12 or Health Benefit and Enrollment History Page after confirmation from my|CalPERS and/or STD. 692. The effective date to cancel the cash is the same date as the enrollment into health and/or dental benefits. CalHR will consider the facts presented and may allow enrollment on a prospective or retroactive basis within IRS regulations.

7. For Permitting Event Codes 37, 38 and 39, which all allow a cancellation or change in the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA), the specific effective date rules may cause the employee to lose the funds if their Dependent Care costs change before the effective date.

Departments should submit an explanation in writing along with the STD. 701R to make the effective date correspond with the Dependent Care cost change.

In accordance with IRS regulations which prohibit the deferral of compensation; under no circumstances will retroactivity into a prior plan year be allowed for the Reimbursement Accounts. In those instances where CalHR approves retroactivity, it will only be approved for the CURRENT plan year.

In cases where the department feels they are not at fault and the employee is not being allowed to enroll or make changes, or is not being enrolled with the earliest possible effective date, the employee may seek financial remedy by filing a claim through the Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board against his/her department for the amount of money and/or tax savings they believe they did not receive.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"708. Open Enrollment Period
The FlexElect Open Enrollment Period is usually in September and October. The specific open enrollment period dates will be communicated to departments prior to the beginning of the open enrollment period. Employees must sign and submit their FlexElect documents, including HBD-12’s and STD. 692’s to their department no later than the last day of the open enrollment period. The effective date of any action during open enrollment is January 1, of the following year.

A memo that includes specific open enrollment information regarding cut-off dates for submission of FlexElect documents to SCO will be sent by CalHR to departments prior to the beginning of the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period. In cases where FlexElect Open Enrollment forms are not submitted by the prescribed deadlines, departments may wish to submit an enrollment appeal to CalHR. Please see Section 707, Enrollment Appeal Process, for information regarding the “Enrollment Appeal Process”.

Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts
To enroll in the Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts, employees must complete a Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R). If employees enroll in the Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts, they must reenroll every year they wish to participate by completing a Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R) during the annual FlexElect Open Enrollment Period. For employees who are enrolling/reenrolling into the Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA), departments are required to provide each MRA participant with an Initial COBRA Notification at the commencement of their coverage. Please see Section 712 of this manual for additional information regarding COBRA.

Cash Option Enrollments/Reenrollments
Employees, except permanent intermittent (PI) employees, currently enrolled in the Cash Option will be automatically reenrolled into the Cash Option for the next FlexElect Plan Year. It is not necessary for these employees to complete a Cash Option Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701C) during the open enrollment period, unless they wish to cancel or change their Cash Option enrollment.

Exception to Automatic Reenrollment
PI employees must reenroll each FlexElect Open Enrollment Period in order to receive the Cash Option. The automatic enrollment continuation does not apply to PIs because part of their eligibility requires completion of a specific number of work hours each plan year and a separate payment process. For more information please see PI Eligibility for Cash Option in Section 710, Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Enrollment.

New enrollments
Employees who are not currently enrolled in the Cash Option, and wish to enroll for the following FlexElect Plan Year, must complete a Cash Option Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701C) during the current FlexElect Open Enrollment Period. After initially enrolling in the Cash Option, enrollment will automatically continue in future plan years. In order to cancel or change a Cash Option enrollment due to a change in status event or during open enrollment, employees are required to complete a STD. 701C.

Other forms and coordination between departments
If other enrollment forms (i.e. HBD-12, or Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS, STD. 692, etc.) are also being submitted for the spouse/domestic partner of an employee, they must be coordinated and submitted as a package, along with the employee’s FlexElect form. The department with the employee who is enrolling in FlexElect must assume the responsibility of coordinating all of the forms. If both employees enroll in FlexElect, one of the departments must assume responsibility for coordinating all of the forms. All forms should be reviewed by the Personnel Office to ensure they are completed accurately.

The FlexElect Open Enrollment Period allows FlexElect enrollees and their State-employed spouses/domestic partners to coordinate their health benefit enrollment. During the open enrollment period, both FlexElect enrollees, spouses, and domestic partners who maintain the traditional health coverage may change health plans.

All FlexElect open enrollment packages must be sent to SCO at the following address:

State Controller’s Office
Division of Personnel/Payroll Services
Flexible Benefits Unit
P.O. Box 942850
Sacramento, CA 94250-5878

Corrections/Cancellations/Changes to Open Enrollment FlexElect Forms

FlexElect Program,"709. Newly Eligible Enrollments
In order to enroll into FlexElect outside of the annual FlexElect Open Enrollment Period, employees must enroll as “newly eligible”. Newly eligible enrollments have a Standard Effective Date, as described on the FlexElect Permitting Event Chart (Appendix A). Newly eligible employees must elect enrollment within 60 days after becoming eligible and they must meet the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 704 of this manual. Newly eligible employees are:

New State employees hired outside of the open enrollment period;
Employees whose time base/employee designation changes from one that was not eligible to one that is eligible or a PI who changes to a permanent position with a time-base of half-time or more;
Employees who were on an approved leave of absence during the entire open enrollment period;
Employees, not currently enrolled in FlexElect, who experience a valid change in status event as defined in Appendix A. In addition, if the employee’s change in status event results in a concurrent approved leave of absence (e.g. birth of child/maternity leave), the employee may enroll by the deadlines specified in the permitting event chart after the employee returns to work.
Health and/or Dental Plan Form Coordination
Employees may make certain changes to their medical/dental insurance for purposes of enrolling in FlexElect. The type of change is based on the permitting event. Refer to the CalPERS Health Benefits and the Dental Procedures Manuals to determine if the event is one that will allow employees to make a change and for the appropriate reason codes, etc.

Maximum Contribution for Newly Eligible Enrollments (Reimbursement Accounts)
Employees who enroll mid-year into either of the reimbursement accounts can still contribute the annual maximum. Therefore, the monthly maximum deduction would not be limited to $220.83 for the Medical Reimbursement Account or $416.66 for the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. For example, an employee enrolls into FlexElect as a new State employee with an effective date of May 1. The employee wants to contribute the maximum of $5,000 into a Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. The employee’s deduction would begin with his/her April pay period paycheck (dated May 1) and end with his/her November pay period paycheck (dated December 1). This employee’s monthly contribution into the account would be $625.00 (8 months x $625 = $5,000). This employee could request reimbursement for dependent care services received between May 1 and December 31 of the plan year.

To enroll as newly eligible, employees must complete all of the appropriate forms that must be submitted as a package. In completing the STD. 701R and/or STD. 701C, the following information should be entered on the form(s) by the department:

Effective Date: Current or prospective basis (i.e. First of the following month when the correctly completed enrollment form is received at SCO by the 10th and does not have to be returned to the agency for correction). The last possible effective date for a newly eligible enrollment is December 1.
Permitting Event Date: Date employee became newly eligible.
Permitting Event Code: 01
Remarks: Indicate how the employee became newly eligible (i.e., new hire, new marriage, birth of child, etc.)
The term newly eligible only applies to employees who are not currently enrolled in any of the FlexElect options and meet the above criteria. This means that current FlexElect enrollees who request enrollment into another FlexElect option are processed as changes, not newly eligible enrollments.

Required Notice for Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA) Enrollees
Departments are required to provide each MRA participant (at the time of enrollment) with an Initial COBRA Notification, which outlines participant rights to continue participation under COBRA should they lose coverage based on a qualifying event. Please see Section 712 for additional COBRA information.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"710. Permanent-Intermittent (PI) Enrollment
Permanent-Intermittent (PI) employees may enroll, but have limited eligibility. The only FlexElect option available to a PI is the Cash Option. PI employees are not eligible to enroll a Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Account.

All PIs who expect to qualify for FlexElect during the next plan year must make an election to enroll in the Cash Option during the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period by completing a Cash Option Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701C). Participation in the FlexElect Program will be contingent on meeting the required eligibility criteria. In the event PIs who have enrolled during the open enrollment period do not qualify, their STD. 701C form, which was retained by the department during open enrollment, should not be processed. The employees will have another opportunity to enroll in FlexElect during the next open enrollment period.

PI employees hired after the open enrollment period, but prior to January 1 of the next plan year, may enroll in FlexElect, however, they must meet the eligibility criteria (as outlined in the Section 710’s Cash Option – PI Employees) before their Cash Option enrollment can become effective.

PI employees who enroll in FlexElect may not cancel or change their FlexElect elections, including their choice of State-sponsored health and/or dental plans, during the plan year unless they experience a valid change in status event as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. Please see Section 705, Election Changes/Change in Status Events, for information regarding changes in status events.

In addition to changes or cancellations that PI employees may initiate as a result of a valid change in status, their participation in the FlexElect Program is contingent on meeting the specific eligibility criteria for the PI Eligibility for Cash Option in Section 710 of this manual.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"PI’s and the Premium Only Plan (POP)
With the Premium Only Plan (POP), the employees’ share of their health and/or dental insurance premiums is deducted from their paycheck before federal, state, and social security taxes are withheld. Please see Section 703 for more information regarding POP.

PI Eligibility for POP
In order to participate in POP, PI employees must qualify for health/dental benefits by earning at least 480 paid hours during each control period (January through June; and, July through December) or to continue enrollment, at least 960 paid hours during two consecutive control periods (prior and current). If after enrolling in a health and/or dental plan, PIs pay an out-of-pocket premium deduction, it will automatically be deducted on a pretax basis. Since POP enrollment is automatic there are no enrollment forms required.

Cash Option – PI Employees
PI employees do not receive the Cash Option on a monthly basis. Instead, they receive the Cash as a single, lump sum six-month payment in lieu of enrollment in a State-sponsored health and/or dental plan for the January through June control period of each plan year for which they are enrolled. They are not eligible to receive the Cash for the July through December control period because such payment would not be made until the next plan year. Cash Option payments made in a subsequent plan year is considered a deferral of compensation and is strictly prohibited by the IRS. Cash Option payments are taxable and are available to PI employees as follows:

$768 in lieu of health benefits
$72 in lieu of dental benefits
$840 in lieu of health and dental benefits
All PI Cash Option payments are subject to the annual $12.00 FlexElect administrative fee.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"PI Eligibility for Cash Option
In order to participate and receive the FlexElect Cash payment, a PI employee must meet ALL of the criteria specified below:

must have completed a STD. 701C during the open enrollment period, or as newly eligible after open enrollment, but prior to January 1 AND
must have been eligible to be enrolled in health and/or dental insurance for the entire January through June control period (eligibility gained as of January 1 but not effective until February 1 meets this criteria) AND
must be paid for at least 480 hours worked during the January through June control period (*see notes below regarding multiple PI positions and NDI time) AND
have a PI appointment from January 1 through June 30 of the Plan Year for which they have enrolled (with no break in service).
In situations where an employee maintains multiple PI appointments during the January through June control period, the department may count the hours worked from the multiple positions regardless of whether the multiple positions are within one department or multiple departments.

PI’s may not use NDI or SDI time to count towards their 480 qualifying hours in a control period to qualify for the lump-sum cash payment.

Form Submission for Cash Option – PI Employees
The following information covers the types of actions which can occur during the open enrollment period.

Employees who were eligible for health and/or dental but were not currently enrolled and were electing the Cash Option in lieu of medical and/or dental.

These employees must have completed a STD. 701C during the open enrollment period. On or after July 1, Departments will verify the qualifying hours during the January-June control period. For those employees who worked the required 480 hours AND meet the other eligibility criteria, the STD. 701C should be forwarded along with a STD. 674 to SCO to request the Cash Option payment. In the Remarks section of the STD. 674 put the following language:  I certify this PI employee has worked 480 hours during the January – June YEAR Control Period and meets all other eligibility criteria for the FlexElect Cash Option payment of $xxx.00.

Employees who cancelled their health and/or dental benefits effective January 1 in order to obtain the Cash Option in lieu of medical and/or dental.

During the open enrollment period, these employees would have completed a STD. 701C AND in addition an HBD-12 and/or a STD. 692 to cancel their current benefits effective January 1. The HBD-12 or Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS and/or STD. 692 should have been forwarded immediately to SCO as instructed below:

Permitting Event Code: 36a (For STD. 692)
Reason Code: 503 (For HBD-12)
Remarks Section of both HBD-12 and STD. 692: “PI canceling benefits to enroll in Cash Option”
Department forwards HBD-12 or Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS and STD. 692 to SCO.
Department retains the STD. 701C until completion of the January through June control period.
If employee meets all the Cash Option eligibility criteria, the STD. 701C is sent to SCO with a STD. 674 requesting the Cash Option payment see Example 7 in Section 723.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"Document Submission Deadline for Cash Option Payment – PI Employees
The STD. 701C and STD. 674 for PI employees who qualify for the Cash Option payment must be received at SCO by September 1 (or the next business day if September 1 falls on a weekend or holiday). All requests for payment received at SCO after September 1, will be returned unprocessed to the Department.

Impact of Time Base Changes on FlexElect Eligibility for PI Employees
PI employees who accept a limited-term appointment will not be eligible for the Cash Option as they will not meet ALL PI eligibility criteria described on PI Eligibility for Cash Option in Section 710 of this manual.

PI employees who are appointed to a permanent position with a time-base of half-time or more, lose eligibility for the PI cash payment, and MUST complete a new STD. 701C within 60 days after their appointment to enroll as a newly eligible permanent employee. Additionally, they become newly eligible to enroll in a Medical and/or Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. Permitting Event Code 01 should be used on the STD. 701C and/or STD 701R.

FlexElect participants with a time base of half-time or more who change to PI status MUST CANCEL their FlexElect participation (Cash Option and/or Reimbursement Account) effective the first of the second month following the date of becoming a PI. Those employees who change to PI status after the open enrollment period but prior to January 1 of the following plan year must wait until the next open enrollment period to request enrollment as a PI.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"Cancellation of FlexElect as a Result of a Time Base Change to Permanent-Intermittent
Employees canceling their FlexElect as a result of a time base change to PI must complete a new STD. 701C as follows:

Effective Date First of the second month following the date of becoming a PI.
Permitting Event 41
Permitting Event Date: Date of time base change
Remarks Section: Enter – “FlexElect Cancellation/Time Base Change to Intermittent.”
PI employees who were enrolled in the Medical Reimbursement Account based on their former eligible time base may continue to make payments into their account through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). By continuing under COBRA the employee will be able to claim expenses incurred after the date of cancellation. Employees who choose not to continue under COBRA will only be able to claim those expenses incurred prior to the date of cancellation. See COBRA information and instructions in Section 712.

PI Eligibility Audit
Since PI eligibility in the FlexElect Program is based on eligibility for health/dental benefits and completion of the required number of paid hours worked within a control period, the State Controller’s Office will verify the paid hours worked prior to issuing the cash payment.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"711. Change in Pay Status While Enrolled in FlexElect
Non-Industrial Disability (NDI)
If employees go on NDI while enrolled in FlexElect, all of their FlexElect elections will remain in effect and will be reflected on their NDI paycheck (i.e. Cash Options, and/or reimbursement account deductions, etc.).

Industrial Disability Leave (IDL) and Temporary Disability (TD)
If employees go on IDL or TD while enrolled in FlexElect, and they elected to receive the Cash Option for health and/or dental, their cash elections will remain in effect. Employees will receive a separate check for the Cash Option, which will be issued approximately one week after their IDL or TD paycheck is issued. If they elected to enroll in one or both of the reimbursement accounts, their deductions into the account(s) will stop for as long as they are on IDL or TD. If the employees return to regular pay status within the FlexElect Plan Year, their reimbursement account deductions will resume. However, if employees go on IDL or TD with Supplementation (IDLS or TDS), their reimbursement account deductions will continue provided the amount of their supplementation income is large enough to cover the full amount of their monthly reimbursement account deduction.

State Disability Insurance (SDI)
For employees in Bargaining Units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 20, and 21: If employees go on SDI while enrolled in a reimbursement account and/or cash option, their enrollment will stop while they are on leave unless they supplement their SDI payment with sick leave, annual leave or vacation.  If they supplement, their reimbursement account deductions may continue.  If they return to pay status in the same FlexElect plan year, their enrollment will resume. If they are enrolled in the medical reimbursement account and wish to continue to submit claims for services provided during their unpaid leave of absence, they may elect to continue to make contributions through COBRA.

Unpaid Leave of Absence
If employees leave “pay status” while enrolled in FlexElect, their FlexElect elections will stop for as long as they continue to remain on unpaid leave. For those employees who are enrolled in the automatic Cash Option, their Cash Option election will resume when they return to pay status.

Employees enrolled in the reimbursement accounts, must return to pay status within the FlexElect Plan Year, in order for their FlexElect elections to resume. In addition, Medical Reimbursement Account (MRA) participants may have coverage continuation rights under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Please see the “Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act” (below) for information regarding MRA enrollment continuation.

Military Leave
Pursuant to Government Code Section 19775.18, state employees called to active military duty for the War on Terrorism are eligible to retain their State benefits for up to 730 calendar days. If an employee is currently receiving Flex Cash in lieu of qualifying group health and/or dental benefits, he/she may continue to receive the cash for the duration of their military leave, not to exceed the time limits mentioned above. Military Leave is not a permitting event to newly enroll into the Flex Cash Program.

Employees enrolled in the medical reimbursement account may elect to continue their coverage via COBRA, or their deductions will stop for the duration of their leave.

Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief (HEART) Act
The HEART Act of 2008 amended Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 125, which allows military personnel called to duty the ability to receive taxable distribution of unused medical care spending account (or Medical Reimbursement Account) funds. This distribution is not available to employees enrolled in a dependent care reimbursement account. The Act defines the distribution as a “Qualified Reservist Distribution” (QRD). In order to be eligible for a QRD, the employee who is enrolled in a MRA must meet the following requirements:

Be a member of a “reserve component” (as defined in Section 101 of Title 37 of the United States Code), which means a member of the Army National Guard; the Reserve for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard; Air National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Services;
Be called or ordered to active military duty for (i) 180 days or more or (ii) for an indefinite period;
Be a participant in the MRA on the date called or ordered to duty; and
Satisfy the Plan’s election requirements for a Qualified Reservist Distribution (QRD).
If an employee believes that he/she is eligible for a QRD, they must contact their department  to complete Attachment I – Qualified Reservist Distribution Request Form (CalHR 902).  The department will need to confirm that the employee meets the QRD requirements reflected above. The form must be submitted by March 15th of the following year of participation to request a QRD. The form is located on CalHR’s web site as a fill and print document in the forms directory.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"712. COBRA
Federal Legislation (Public Law 99-272, Title X), entitled Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), requires that employers allow FlexElect participants who are enrolled in a MRA to continue their enrollment in the event they lose their coverage due to one of the qualifying events listed below.

Voluntary or Involuntary Termination or Reduction of Hours*
Retirement
Death of Employee
*Reduction of hours includes: Full-time to part-time, strikes, layoffs, leave of absence, military call-up, and permanent-intermittent.

If employees elect to continue enrollment under COBRA, the pre-taxed funds they have already contributed to their MRA will be available for reimbursement of any future eligible expenses they may incur (through the end of the plan year), for as long as they continue to make monthly COBRA premium payments.

It is important to note that COBRA premiums are not pre-taxed as the participant no longer has a monthly income to reduce his/her tax liability. If employees choose NOT to continue enrollment under COBRA, the pre-taxed funds they have already contributed to their MRA will only be available for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred before the loss of coverage.

“Internal Revenue Service” does not require “COBRA” enrollment to continue payments into an employee’s Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (only a Medical Reimbursement Account).

COBRA Initial Notice
The COBRA Initial Notice is the first of the two required COBRA notices. In compliance with the provisions of COBRA requiring the employer to notify participants of their COBRA rights, the department  must provide the initial notice to employees within 90 days of their enrollment in the MRA (i.e., when they first become covered under the MRA). An exception to the 90-day rule is when a qualifying event occurs before the initial notice is provided. In that case, an initial notice must be provided along with the election notice and election form.

The COBRA Initial Notice is intended to provide a summary of their right to continue the MRA under COBRA if they experience a COBRA qualifying event. This is not a COBRA Election Notice. See Attachment C – COBRA Initial Notice, for a sample of an Initial COBRA Notification. The COBRA Initial Notice is also available on CalHR’s web site.

COBRA Election Notice and COBRA Election Form (CalHR 689)
The department should be aware of when an employee dies, termination from employment, or a reduction in hours that results in a loss of eligibility. At the time the qualifying event has occurred or when notified timely of a qualifying event, the department must provide within 14 days, a COBRA Election Notice (see Attachment D – COBRA Election Notice for a sample) and COBRA Election Form (CalHR 689) (see Attachment E – COBRA Election Form (CalHR 689) for a sample) to the employee. The COBRA Election Notice and Election Form is also available on CalHR’s web site.

A Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R) should also be included with the notification. If the COBRA enrollment is elected, the department should assist in the completion of the STD. 701R. After the completed STD. 701R, COBRA Election Form, and initial COBRA payment is returned, the department should retain copies for their records and submit the original package to CalHR.

Employee Responsibility – The employee has the responsibility to inform the department when a qualifying event occurs. The department must receive the notification within 60 days after the date of the event or the date on which coverage is lost. If the notice to the department is not received timely, then COBRA continuation coverage will not be offered.

Employee Responsibility After Receiving COBRA Election Notice and COBRA Election Form
If the employee wishes to elect COBRA, he/she must complete the COBRA Election Form and a STD. 701R for “COBRA Continuation” and send both documents to the department within 60 days from the date of the COBRA Election Notice.

In addition, the enrollee must submit a personal check, money order, or cashier’s check payable to CalHR in the amount of one monthly premium plus an additional 2% for administrative costs. For example, if a participant elects to continue a MRA at $100.00 a month, the total monthly COBRA premium will be $102.00. Subsequently, by the first of each month employees are responsible for submitting their COBRA payment to CalHR.

CalHR’s Responsibility After Receiving Completed COBRA Election Form

CalHR will send a COBRA Enrollment Confirmation Memo to participants. CalHR will process participants’ payments and ensure the amounts are credited to their MRA.

Events Resulting in the Loss of COBRA Coverage
Failure to pay the required contributions within the prescribed timeframes.
Failure to request reimbursement for valid medical expenses by June 30 for the prior plan year account.
Form Completion
The Reimbursement Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R) is used as the COBRA Continuation Verification notice. Only the following sections should be completed:

Section 1: Mark “COBRA Continuation of MRA”.
Section 2: Indicate the Social Security Number of the enrolled employee.
Section 5A: Indicate the monthly COBRA contribution amount (not including the administrative fee).
Section 7: Participant must provide their original signature/date.
Section 8: Indicate the effective date of the COBRA enrollment which is the month following their last paycheck. For example, if the employee is paid on August 1st for the July pay period, the effective date for the COBRA contribution should be September 1st. See Example 9 in Section 723.
Section 10: Indicate the date of the qualifying event; i.e., date of retirement, date of termination of employment.
Sections 14-15: Indicate appropriate information.
Section 16: Indicate the type of qualifying event, i.e., retirement, termination of employment. Provide participant’s phone number and home address. A confirmation statement will be sent to the address you provide.

FlexElect Program,"713. Retiring While Enrolled in FlexElect
Retired employees are not eligible for FlexElect. Accordingly, there are several different situations that may apply to employees who retire while enrolled in FlexElect. The following gives examples of these situations and the appropriate action that should be taken.

If employees retire and;

1. choose the Cash Option instead of their own medical insurance plan;
Employees have up to 30 days prior to and 60 days following, the date of their retirement to enroll in any California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) medical insurance plan. If employees do not enroll within the specified time period, they must wait until the next health open enrollment period. The enrollment at that point would be handled through CalPERS.

Form processing:

Enrolls in a health plan up to 30 days prior to retirement: Employees must complete an HBD-12 to enroll in health and a STD. 701C to cancel their FlexElect enrollment. The Permitting Event Code to be used on the STD. 701C is 88, and the Permitting Event Date is the date the HBD-12 is received in the employing office (as shown on the form). Both forms should be submitted as a package to SCO for processing.
Enrolls in a health plan no later than 60 days after retirement: The department must complete an HBD-12 and submit to CalPERS for processing. It is not necessary for employees to complete a STD. 701C to cancel their FlexElect as their enrollment will be automatically terminated upon their retirement in SCO’s payroll system.
2. choose the Cash Option instead of their own dental insurance plan;
Employees have up to 30 days prior to and 60 days following the date of their retirement to enroll in a State-sponsored dental insurance plan. If employees do not enroll within the specified time period, they must wait until the next dental open enrollment period. The enrollment at that point would be handled through CalPERS.

Form processing:

Enrolls in a dental plan up to 30 days prior to retirement: Employees must complete a STD. 692 to enroll in dental and a STD. 701C to cancel their FlexElect enrollment. The Permitting Event Code to be used on the STD. 701C is 88, and the Permitting Event Date is the date the STD. 692 is received in the employing office (as shown on the form). Both forms should be submitted as a package to SCO for processing.
Enrolls in a dental plan no later than 60 days after retirement: The department must complete a STD. 692 and submit to CalPERS for processing. It is not necessary for employees to complete a STD. 701C to cancel their FlexElect as their enrollment will be automatically terminated upon their retirement in SCO’s payroll system.
3. retain their State-sponsored medical insurance plan;
No action is necessary for employees to continue their medical insurance benefit into retirement. CalPERS will automatically continue employees’ medical plans in retirement.

4. retain their own State-sponsored dental insurance;
The department will need to complete a STD. 692 to continue the employee’s dental insurance benefits into retirement. This form is necessary because CalPERS processes dental enrollments for retirees and retiree information must be entered into the CalPERS’ database.

5. use the Medical Reimbursement Account;
Deductions into the account will automatically stop upon retirement. Employees may continue their Medical Reimbursement Account contributions under COBRA. See COBRA information and enrollment instructions in Section 712, COBRA.

6. use the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account.
Deductions into the account will automatically stop upon retirement. Retired employees cannot continue their dependent care contributions under COBRA.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program

Unit 6 employees may NOT enroll in the Cash Option in lieu of dental insurance. There are no exceptions to this restriction which is part of the union’s trust agreement. Unit 6 employees MAY enroll in the Cash Option in lieu of medical insurance and one or both of the reimbursement accounts.

If a Unit 6 employee is enrolling in the Cash Option in lieu of medical insurance and chooses not to enroll in a union-sponsored dental plan, you must enter “N/A” (not applicable) on the STD. 701C in Section 4 Item B. Even though this employee does not wish to enroll in the union-sponsored dental plan, he/she will not be able to receive cash in lieu of dental insurance.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program

In cases of two married or two domestic partner State employees, where more than one employing department is involved and both employees are making changes in their medical and/or dental insurance for purposes of enrolling in FlexElect, the department staff with the employee enrolling in FlexElect, should assume the responsibility of coordinating all forms. These forms could include the spouse’s or domestic partner’s Health Benefits Enrollment (HBD-12) or Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS and/or the Dental Plan Enrollment Authorization (STD. 692) forms. All forms must be submitted as a package to SCO with the FlexElect Enrollment Forms(s) (STD. 701C and/or STD. 701R). In the event both employees enroll in FlexElect, one department should assume responsibility to coordinate all the enrollment documents and send them to the SCO as a package. When applicable include the spouse’s or domestic partner’s SSN on all forms.

In addition to the FlexElect Enrollment Authorization Forms (STD. 701C/ STD. 701R), a Health Benefits Enrollment Form (HBD-12) Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS and/or Dental Plan Enrollment Authorization (STD. 692) are required if employees are:

Changing their current health and/or dental plan to different carriers.
Changing the number of dependents on their health and/or dental plan.
Cancelling their health and/or dental plan. Remember, those employees who cancel and become a dependent on their spouses or domestic partner’s plan must also submit their spouses or domestic partner’s HBD-12 and/or STD. 692 if the spouse or domestic partner is a State employee. Also, the effective date of the employee’s cancellation must be the same date the spouse or domestic partner added him/her as a dependent.
If employees do not make any medical or dental insurance plan changes, a HBD-12 or my|CalPERS documentation and/or STD. 692 is not required as a part of the FlexElect package.

CalHR and CalPERS require that a marriage certificate be submitted when a spouse is added. For a domestic partner, the Declaration of Domestic Partnership and Statement of Financial Liability must be submitted. These documents should be maintained in the employee’s Personnel file. This requirement applies at the time of a new enrollment, a new marriage, domestic partnership, during the open enrollment period, or through the Health Statement Application process.

CalHR and CalPERS also require an Affidavit of Eligibility to enroll an economically dependent child who resides with the employee in a regular parent/child relationship. Please refer to the CalPERS Health Benefits Procedures Manual and the CalHR State Dental Program Procedures Manual for instructions on these requirements. Failure to submit these documents with the FlexElect package when required may delay the processing of all documents in the FlexElect package and thereby impact the effective date of an eligible enrollment.

FlexElect Program,"719. Employee not Re-Enrolling
If employees do not elect to reenroll in the FlexElect Program for the next Plan Year and do not wish to make any changes to their medical and/or dental insurance, they will not be required to complete a HBD-12 and/or STD. 692 to continue their traditional medical and dental insurance at their current level of benefits.

Employees who were enrolled in the Cash Option and do not want to be automatically reenrolled will need to cancel their enrollment. In addition, in order to obtain State-sponsored benefits they MUST reenroll in a medical and/or dental insurance plan.

Reenrollment into traditional health and/or dental is NOT automatic for Cash Option participants who elect to cancel their enrollment. Completion of the HBD-12/STD. 692 forms are required. In this instance, they should follow the instructions on page 32.

If employees do not wish to reenroll in the FlexElect Program for the next plan year and wish to make changes to their medical and/or dental insurance, they MUST complete a HBD-12 and/or STD. 692 reflecting the changes. The HBD-12 should be sent to CalPERS for processing and the STD. 692 should be sent to the SCO for processing.

The HBD-12 and/or STD. 692 must be completed during the FlexElect Open Enrollment Period. Use the following information when completing these forms:
Effective Date: January 1 (of the following year)
Permitting Event Date: Beginning of open enrollment date (of the current year)
Reason Code: 104 (HBD-12)
Permitting Event Code: 03 (STD. 692)
Remarks: Enter “Employee cancelling FlexElect and reenrolling in traditional State-sponsored medical (or dental) insurance.”
For dental insurance, remember the choice employees made for dental insurance is a three-year commitment. Accordingly, if employees opted out of dental and received cash, they cannot reenroll in a State-sponsored dental plan, for three years, unless they lose their “other” coverage (under spouse, domestic partner, or other coverage). Please see Section 702, Plan Options, for more information regarding the three-year commitment.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"720. Forms Distribution
The FlexElect Handbook contains one copy of both the Cash Option Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701C) and the Reimbursement Account Enrollment Authorization (STD. 701R). If employees enroll by using one of these forms, two additional copies of the form must be photocopied. Return one copy to the employee for his/her personal records; retain one copy in the department. Be sure to attach all other appropriate forms (i.e. HBD-12 Health Benefit and Enrollment History page after confirmation from my|CalPERS, STD. 692) to the original.

Distribution is as follows:

Original – SCO
Copy – Agency
Copy – Employee (STD. 701C)
Copy – Employee (STD. 701R)
Send completed enrollment forms to:

State Controllers’ Office
Division of Personnel/Payroll Services
Flexible Benefits Unit

FlexElect Program,"721. Correcting FlexElect Open Enrollment Documents
FlexElect packages will be audited by SCO staff to ensure all forms are completed correctly. If a HBD-12 Health Benefit is attached SCO will forward it to CalPERS. If a STD 692 is included it will be audited as well. This audit includes ensuring that:

the employee is eligible to enroll in FlexElect and,
signatures are completed, and
reimbursement account deductions are within minimum/maximum dollar limits.
If errors are found on the initial “face audit” of the enrollment forms, SCO will return the package to the department with a Discrepancy Notice (PR 250J). If no errors are found, the forms will be processed.

During processing, SCO’s database system will also audit the forms. If an error is found during this audit process, SCO will return enrollment forms to the department accompanied by a PR 250J.

Forms should be corrected immediately and returned to SCO along with the discrepancy notice. The corrected form(s) MUST note at the top of the form(s) “CORRECTED FORM”. CalPERS requests that the reference to “CORRECTED FORM” be placed in the Remarks Section of the HBD-12 and not across the top. It is important returned forms be given priority and are corrected and resubmitted to SCO immediately. This will ensure the transactions are processed so the employees’ FlexElect elections are in effect on their paycheck dated January 1. It will also help to eliminate any retroactive issues which may cause the effective date to be changed because the new plan year has started.

Corrected or new enrollment forms “replace” the preceding forms, so it is important ALL information be provided, not just those items that need corrections.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program
FlexElect Program,"722. Cancellations/Changes to Open Enrollment Documents
Employees who enroll or make changes to their FlexElect during the open enrollment period and employees who are automatically reenrolled into the Cash Option are allowed by Internal Revenue Code 125 to cancel or change their elections until December 31 of the current plan year. A new STD. 701C and/or STD. 701R must be completed AND signed by the employee by December 31. No new enrollments or changes will be allowed in any options not elected during the open enrollment period. Once the new plan year begins, employees may not cancel or change their FlexElect enrollment unless they experience a valid change in status. Please see Section 705, Election Changes/Change in Status Events, for more information regarding valid changes in status.

The correcting form must be received by SCO no later than January 10 (or the next business day if January 10 falls on a weekend or holiday). Correcting forms received by SCO by December 5 (or the next business day if December 5 falls on a weekend or holiday) will be reflected on the December pay warrants dated January 1. Correcting forms received after December 5 will require retroactive adjustments. It is not necessary to send these types of correcting forms to CalHR for approval; SCO will process.

All sections on the form must be completed just as if the election had been made during the open enrollment period. The information on the form should reflect the changes you are requesting. For example, if you are deleting the dental cash, but maintaining the medical cash, the amount of $128 should be listed on 4A as well as the total on 4C of the STD. 701C. For a change in a reimbursement account, simply list the correct deduction amount(s) on lines 5A and/or B on the STD. 701R.
The department will complete their appropriate sections and forward to SCO.
If the HBD-12 (Health) and STD. 692 (Dental) forms were completed cancelling coverage and the employee now wants to maintain coverage, new forms reenrolling the employee must be completed and forwarded along with the STD. 701C.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/flexelect-program/,FlexElect Program

Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2201. General Information
The Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program is a voluntary payroll deduction program that allows employees to deduct a specified pre-tax dollar amount for work-related parking fees. Money is deducted from the employee’s paycheck prior to tax deductions. As a result the employee’s taxable income is reduced. Once the employee’s pre-tax parking deduction is established, it continues without interruption until terminated or changed by the employee. At the end of the tax year, the SCO will report the employee’s taxable income as usual and excludes the amount of the pre-tax parking reimbursement deduction from their gross taxable income.

Unless an employee has appointments with more than one department in different locations or the employee’s duties require him/her to parking in different locations, state employees are limited to one (1) parking space each.

Three types of pre-tax parking payroll deductions
1.  Department of General Services (DGS)

This pre-tax parking payroll deduction program is available to any state employee who can acquire a parking space in a state-owned garage and/or parking lot managed by DGS. This program is administered by DGS, Office of Fleet and Asset Management (OFAM).
The State Controller’s Office (SCO) deducts the parking fees from the employee’s check and remits them directly to DGS/OFAM. It is the only parking payment made on behalf of the employee for their parking. SCO’s deduction code for the DGS/OFAM parking deduction is 360-001.
2. Department-Sponsored Parking

Departments that have “in-house” parking programs administer their own programs. The deduction codes for these programs are setup by the SCO Deduction Program Coordinator. The departments enroll employees using their unique deduction code 360-xxx. SCO deducts the parking fees from the employee’s check and transfers them to the department. Department pays the parking for each employee.
3. Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program

This program is for employees who do not have access to DGS/OFAM parking spaces or a department-sponsored parking program. While an employee can have his/her parking fees deduced pre-tax from his/her paycheck, he/she must first pay for the parking directly to the parking facility and get a receipt. The employee then submits a claim to a third party record keeper for reimbursement.
The Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program is administered by the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR). CalHR contracts with a third-party administrator (TPA) for recordkeeping and claims adjudication. SCO’s deduction code for the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program is 361-001.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2202. Authority
The Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program is regulated by Section 132 (f) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) – Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits.

“Qualified parking” defined by the IRC:
Parking on or near the employer’s business premise or at a location from which the employee commutes to work by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit facilities, transportation provided by any person in the business of transporting persons for compensation or hire, or by any other means.

Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2206. Enrollment
DGS/OFAM Administered Parking
Employee who acquires a DGS parking space must complete the “Application for Parking” form (OFAM 112) and submit it to their Departmental Transportation Coordinator (DTC) or Employee Parking Unit (EPU) for processing. The employee pays parking fees in advance to cover the period prior to start of the first payroll deduction. The advance payment must be by check, money order, or credit/debit card (Sacramento only).

The DTC then forwards the completed OFAM 112 form to DGS/OFAM. Upon receipt of the employee’s OFAM 112 form, OFAM completes the State Controller’s Office (SCO) “Notice to State Controller of Payroll Authorization” form (CD88) and forwards it to the SCO’s Miscellaneous Deduction Unit by the 10th of the month.

Department-Sponsored Parking
Employee completes the parking facility’s application and pays parking fees in advance to cover the period prior to start of the first payroll deduction. The employee may also be required to pay a refundable deposit for a key card to the parking facility.

The employee gives a copy of his/her parking facility application to his/her department’s DTC or the unit responsible for the department’s parking program. Upon receipt of the employee’s application, the DTC or Parking Unit completes the SCO’s CD88 and forwards it to SCO’s Miscellaneous Deduction Unit by the 10th of the month.

Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program
Employee completes a CalHR 682 – Account Enrollment Form and submits it to his/her departmental personnel/payroll office. To be effective for the current pay period, the enrollment form must be processed and forwarded to SCO’s Miscellaneous Deduction Unit by the 10th of the month.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2207. Claims Process
If an employee is participating in the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program, the process for submitting reimbursement claims is as follows:

Specified pre-tax reimbursement account dollar is deducted from the employee’s check. The deduction is always for the next month (e.g., the deduction taken in the March pay period is for the month of April).
Employee pays his/her parking fees and receives a receipt for all parking expenditures for the month (e.g., monthly, weekly or daily receipts).
Employee completes a CalHR 681 – Account Claim Form. The employee’s signature on the claim form attests that the reimbursement is for “qualified parking” and that he/she meets the eligibility criteria.
The employee sends the completed reimbursement claim along with the required payment documentation (receipt, copy of money order, copy of cashier’s check, or copy of the front and back of cancelled personal check) to the third party administrator at the address listed on the form for processing.
The reimbursement checks are mailed once a month at the end of the month. Employees must submit claims to the third-party administrator by the 15th of the month to be included in the monthly processing cycle.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2208. Changes
When there is a change to the parking fees of the parking programs administered by DGS/OFAM or department, DGS/OFAM or the department makes the change to the employee’s payroll deduction by completing SCO’s CD88 following notification to the employee. The effective date of the change will be the current pay period if the completed CD88 is received by the SCO’s Miscellaneous Deduction Unit by the 10th of month.

An employee participating in the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program may increase or decrease their pre-tax parking reimbursement account deduction at any time by completing a CalHR 682 – Account Enrollment Form and submitting to his/her personnel/payroll office. The effective date of the change will be the current pay period if the form is received by SCO’s Miscellaneous Deduction Unit by the 10th of the month.

If an employee is changing from the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program to a DGS/OFAM or department parking program or vice versa, the employee must cancel their current program before enrolling in the new program to avoid duplicate deductions and possible forfeiture of pre-tax parking funds. See Section 2209, Cancellations, Section 2210, Forfeiture, and Section 2212, Employee Transfer, for details.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2209. Cancellations
If an employee participates in a parking program administered by DGS/OFAM or a department, he/she must give 30 days’ notice to cancel his/her pre-tax parking deduction. DGS/OFAM or the department completes SCO’s CD88 and forwards it to the Miscellaneous Deduction Unit. If the CD88 is received by the 10th of the month, the cancellation is effective in the current pay period.

An employee participating in the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program may cancel his/her pre-tax deduction at any time by completing the CalHR 682 – Account Enrollment Form and submitting it to his/her departmental personnel/payroll office. The cancellation will be effective in the current pay period if the form is received by SCO by the 10th of the month. If funds remain in the employee’s pre-tax parking reimbursement account and he/she is still an active state employee, the employee has one (1) year from his/her last activity (deduction or claim) in which to submit claims for reimbursement of work-related parking or the remaining funds will be forfeited.

Because the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program differs from the DGS/OFAM or department-sponsored parking program in the way that they are coded and processed, the employee must cancel his/her reimbursement account deduction when he/she transfers from a private parking lot to a DGS/OFAM or departmental administered lot or vice versa. Otherwise, the employee will have duplicate pre-tax parking deductions taken from his/her paycheck and could face forfeiture of his/her unclaimed pre-tax parking funds.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2210. Forfeiture
If an employee participating in the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program cancels his/her pre-tax payroll deduction and has a balance in his/her account, the employee, as an active state employee, has one (1) year from the date of his/her last activity (deduction or submission of a claim) in which to submit a claim with valid parking receipts for reimbursement. Claims must reflect costs incurred while the employee was an active participant in the Program. Costs incurred after the employee’s last date of eligibility are not eligible for reimbursement.

If the employee has separated from state service and has a balance in his/her Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account, he/she has one (1) year from the date of separation in which to submit a claim for reimbursement of work-related parking expenses incurred prior to separation. Costs incurred after the employee’s last date of eligibility are not eligible for reimbursement.

Failure to submit pre-tax parking reimbursement account claims within these specified time periods will result in the forfeiture of these funds.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2211. Leave of Absence
When an employee is on a leave of absence (LOA), the pre-tax parking deduction will continue if there is “sufficient gross” pay. If an employee is on Industrial Disability Leave (IDL) and receiving non-taxable income, the pre-tax parking deduction ceases.

DGS/OFAM Administered Parking
If an employee is on a LOA for more than 90 days, the DGS/OFAM usually requires the employee to cancel his/her pre-tax parking deduction. Each situation is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Department-Sponsored Parking
Depending on the agreement between the department and the owner of the parking garage/parking lot, any employee on a LOA for more than 30 days is usually required to cancel his/her pre-tax parking deduction.

Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program
Since the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program deduction can be cancelled and started at any time during the tax year, the pre-tax parking deduction should be cancelled when the employee is on a LOA of 30 days or more.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2212. Employer Transfer
The pre-tax parking payroll deductions for both DGS/OFAM Administered Parking and the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program continue when an employee transfers from one department to another department. When the employee’s former department processes his/her paperwork, it should ask if he/she will need to continue the pre-tax parking payroll deduction.

If the employee will not be required to pay for parking at his/her new department or will be participating in a department-sponsored pre-tax parking program, he/she should be reminded to cancel his/her pre-tax parking payroll deduction.
If the employee has a pre-tax parking deduction for the DGS/OFAM program, he/she must notify DGS/OFAM and it will complete SCO’s CD88 to cancel the deduction.
If the employee has a pre-tax parking deduction for the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program, he/she must complete a CalHR 682 – Account Enrollment Form to cancel his/her deduction and give to his/her former department’s personnel/payroll office to process and forward to the Miscellaneous Deduction Unit at SCO.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2213. Retroactive Enrollment
Retroactive pre-tax parking deductions are not allowed under the Third Party Pre-Tax Parking Reimbursement Account Program. If the deduction is not taken in the pay period that is requested, the deduction will start in the next pay period.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/pre-tax-parking-program/,Pre-Tax Parking Program
Pre-Tax Parking Program,"2214. Refunds
CalHR reviews refund requests on a case-by-case basis. Refund requests are not permitted for current participants in the program or for participants who have a pending reimbursement claim on file.

The IRC does not allow automatic refunds of pre-tax parking deductions. However, there may be circumstances in which an employee is due a refund (e.g. disability, death delaying in processing cancellation). The request for refunds will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate program administrator (DGS/OFAM, Department or CalHR).

The monthly premiums for the Retiree Vision Program are fully paid by the retiree. Once enrolled, CalPERS will make a monthly deduction from their warrant. If there are insufficient funds to make a deduction, VSP will direct bill the retiree for the cost of the monthly premiums.

California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) retirees will be direct-billed for their monthly premium.
Direct-Billed enrollment length is still the same; failure to continue payment will mean the retiree and any enrolled dependents will become ineligible and the retiree will be disenrolled until the next open enrollment period and plan year.

Employees/retirees/dependents may obtain covered services or materials from any other licensed optometrist, ophthalmologist, or optician of their choice. Services obtained through non-member doctors are subject to the same deductibles and limitations as services through VSP member doctors. The doctor must be paid in full and an itemized receipt is submitted to VSP. VSP will reimburse the employee/retiree/dependent up to the amounts allowed under the state plan’s non- member doctor schedule. The reimbursement schedule does not guarantee full payment nor can VSP guarantee patient satisfaction when services are received from a non-member doctor.

All claims must be filed within six months of the date services were completed. Reimbursement benefits are made directly to the covered employee/retiree/dependent and are not payable to the doctor.

Services obtained from a non-VSP provider are in lieu of obtaining services from a VSP network doctor. Reimbursement benefits are not assignable.

* Determination of “necessary” versus “elective” contact lenses under the non-VSP reimbursement schedule will be consistent with VSP network doctor services. Reimbursement for contact lenses is in lieu of all benefits, including exam and eyewear services.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/vision-care-program/,Vision Care Program
Vision Care Program,"1206. Coordination of Benefits-Dual Coverage
Coordination of Benefits
Covered Persons who are covered under two or more insurance plans that include vision care benefits may be eligible for Coordination of Benefits (“COB”). VSP will combine other insurance plans’ claim payments or reimbursements, if any, with benefits available under Covered Person’s VSP Plan, which may reduce or eliminate covered person’s out-of- pocket expense. Covered persons covered under more than one VSP Plan may also be able to take advantage of COB.

Dual Coverage
A married enrollee whose spouse is also an enrollee under his/her own VSP Plan may coordinate benefits between their respective VSP Plans. Such “dual coverage” will be subject to the same procedures and limitations applicable to coordination of benefits with non-VSP plans.

Eligible married state employees or those state employees with eligible domestic partners may co- cover each other under the state’s Vision Program. This option also applies to their dependent children, including dependents of domestic partners. The procedure for coordination of dual coverage benefits will be as follows:

a) Eligible married state employees or those state employees with eligible domestic partners can receive benefits under each other’s plan and receive two pairs of eyeglasses subject to the independent deductibles and all other plan limitations. Dependent children can receive one pair of eyeglasses under either their parent’s plan, or both, subject to the deductible and plan limitations. In both instances, this provision applies to the active basic and retiree plans, as well as the Premier Vision Plan.

b) Eligible married state employees or those state employees with eligible domestic partners cannot use their secondary coverage to cover the cost of extras.

c) If an eligible employee receives only one pair of eyeglasses, the deductible may be paid by the secondary coverage. In order to process claims involving COB, VSP may need to share personal information regarding Covered Persons with other parties (such as another insurance company). When this is necessary, VSP will only share such information with those persons or organizations having a legitimate interest in that information and only where such sharing is not prohibited by law.

Retirees
Married retirees and registered domestic partners have dual coverage under the state Vision Program if they are enrolled as a dependents on each other’s plan. Dual vision coverage also applies to dependent children if they are enrolled as a dependent on each eligible retiree’s plan (either married or registered domestic partnership).

To utilize this feature of the Vision Program, verification of eligibility must be obtained from VSP for the retiree. One verification will authorize coverage as the retiree and the other verification will authorize coverage as a spouse/domestic partner. Verification of eligibility for retirees should be obtained by the member provider on the initial visit. When services are obtained from a non-member provider, an itemized receipt must be returned to VSP and verification of eligibility should be obtained by the provider.

Dual coverage is permitted for the following scenarios:

Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse or domestic partner of an active employee, enrolled in the state active vision plan.
Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse or domestic partner of an active employee, enrolled in the state active vision plan, and they also have a dependent child.
Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse or domestic partner of an active employee (who is also a dependent child on the Retiree Vision plan), enrolled in the state active vision plan.
Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse or domestic partner of an active (non-state) employee, enrolled in a non-state vision plan.
Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse or domestic partner of a retiree, enrolled in a non-state vision plan.
Retired member is enrolled in the Retiree Vision Program, and they are the spouse of an active (non-state) employee, enrolled in a non-state vision plan, and they have a dependent child.
Coordination of Benefits
When an eligible employee or retiree has coverage through the state’s Vision Program and the spouse or domestic partner has coverage through an employer other than the state of California, the procedure for coordination of benefits will be as follows:

When one pair of glasses is obtained from a member doctor, the benefits can be coordinated to pay for the deductible, if any, plus some cosmetic extras. The secondary plan can be utilized to reimburse deductibles and overages, up to the limit of that plan.
Two pairs of glasses may be received from a member doctor when the benefits are coordinated. The deductible, if any, will apply to the second pair of glasses. However, the first deductible and some cosmetic extras, will be paid for by the eligible employee or dependent obtaining the glasses. If the patient is eligible for an exam under both benefits, then the secondary exam benefit can be used to pick-up the deductibles and overages from the primary benefit, up to the limit of the secondary exam benefit.
When services for one pair of glasses are received from a non-member doctor, VSP will reimburse the patient up to the combined scheduled allowance, not to exceed the actual examination fee and the cost of the materials.
An individual may choose to receive glasses and contact lenses from either a member or non-member doctor and the normal deductible and limitations will apply. If only elective contact lenses are selected, the combined schedule of allowances will apply, not to exceed the actual charges.
When spouses or domestic partners both have coverage through the state’s Vision Program or the Retiree Vision Program or a combination thereof, procedures for coordination of benefits will be as follows:

Employee and spouse/domestic partner can receive benefits under each other’s plan and receive two pair of glasses subject to the independent deductibles and all other plan limitations.
Employee and spouse/domestic partner can use their secondary coverage to cover the cost of extras.
If an employee receives only one pair of glasses, the deductible may be paid by the secondary coverage.
Dependent children can receive one pair of eyeglasses under either their parent’s plan, or both, subject to the deductible and plan limitations. In both instances, this provision applies to the active Basic and retiree plans, as well as the Premier Vision plan. When an eligible employee or retiree has coverage through the state’s Vision Program or Retiree Vision Program and the spouse/domestic partner has coverage through another insurance company, the state’s Vision Program or Retiree Vision Program will be the primary coverage unless the request for payment is submitted with a paid statement from the other insurance carrier. The state’s carrier will then pay the deductible, if any, and services not covered under the other plan, subject to the carrier’s plan provisions and limitations.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/vision-care-program/,Vision Care Program
Vision Care Program,"1207. Direct Payment Process
An active employee on non-pay status may elect to continue vision coverage by paying the total premium directly to the vision carrier. During the period of non-pay status the state contribution towards the vision premium is not paid, therefore, an employee must be advised that they can elect to continue their vision coverage through direct payment in order to maintain coverage.

The Vision Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 703)
The Vision Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 703) is used to enroll eligible employees in Direct Pay. See Attachment D – Vision Plan Direct Payment Authorization (STD. 703) for a copy of the STD. 703 and Section 1212 for completion instructions.

An employee who wishes to continue coverage while off pay status must complete a STD. 703 and forward the form directly to the carrier with a check or money order for a full three-month premium amount. The employee’s enrollment may not exceed the duration of the state’s contract or one year, whichever comes first. However, in the event of an approved extension to the leave of absence, the carrier will accept direct payments beyond the normal one-year period. A newly completed STD. 703 must be completed and submitted to the vision carrier.

An employee who does not elect direct payment must complete Part B of the STD. 703, to decline continued coverage. If the employee elects not to enroll he/she will be liable for any vision expenses incurred while off pay status (vision premiums will not be paid by the state during this period). A copy should be retained in the employee’s personnel file. In this instance, do not send a copy of the STD. 703 to the vision carrier.

Instructions for the completion of the STD. 703 are printed on the reverse side of the form. Personnel staff should verify that all information is completed correctly. Do not forward copies of the STD. 703 to SCO or CalHR.

Absences/Situations Where Coverage Lapses
Leave of absence for one or more full pay periods, but other than NDI, IDL, 4800 Time or Workers Compensation with supplementation.
Appeal of involuntary termination. (COBRA provisions apply; direct payment provisions are not applicable).
Suspension of one or more complete pay periods.
Permanent-Intermittent, enrolled but off pay status (Reduction in hours – COBRA provisions apply, direct payment provisions are not applicable).
Application for disability retirement is pending (employee is off pay status).
Pending IDL determination when all sick leave and vacation credits have been exhausted (employee is off pay status).
Death of an employee (120-day death benefit apply, COBRA is applicable after CalPERS’ determination of survivor benefits).
Under approved SDI benefits.
Direct Payment of Premiums
The vision carrier will not send a monthly bill to an employee who elects to pay premiums directly while he/she is off pay status. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each employee to ensure premium payments are paid timely. Direct pay is normally limited to 12 months. However, in the event of an approved extension to the leave of absence, the carrier will accept direct payments beyond the normal one-year period.
Payments must be paid in advance and cover a minimum period of three months or the length of the absence whichever is less. The employee’s check/money order for the first three months must be attached to the newly completed STD. 703 and sent to the carrier.
The vision carrier must receive the initial payment by the first day of the month following the first full month the employee is off pay status. Subsequent installments and/or final payment are due to the vision carrier by the first of each subsequent three-month period. STD. 703 forms received by the vision carrier without the required payment attached will be returned to the employee. Failure to pay the required payment in a timely manner will result in the employee’s vision coverage being cancelled.
In the event an employee returns to pay status prior to the end of his/her approved leave of absence, it will be the employee’s responsibility to contact the vision carrier to request a refund of any direct premium overpayments paid.
Return to Pay Status
Upon return to pay status (if an employee is still enrolled), the state premium contributions will commence with the first pay warrant issued by SCO.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/vision-care-program/,Vision Care Program
Vision Care Program,"1208. 120-Day Survivor Death Benefit for Continuation of Benefits
Under the 120-day death benefit, departments are required to continue to pay the employer & employee contributions for a covered employee’s spouse, domestic partner and/or other eligible family members for up to 120 days following an employee’s death. This means if an employee was in the Premier vision plan at the time of death, the department is responsible for paying the full premier premium for 120 days. The 120-day period is to provide the family a grace period while the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) determines if the spouse or other family members are eligible for a survivor’s benefit.

In implementing this benefit, departments will use the process used for an employee on an unpaid leave of absence (STD. 703). Under this process, the deceased employee’s department will pay four months of both the employer and employee contributions directly to the vision carrier.

An eligible spouse and/or other eligible dependent(s) who is determined to be an eligible survivor through CalPERS and receives a continuing allowance from CalPERS may continue vision coverage as a retiree.

If CalPERS determines that the spouse and/or other eligible family member(s) is not eligible for a continuing allowance, then the department should notify the spouse and/or other eligible family member(s) of COBRA eligibility within sixty days from the date CalPERS makes this determination. Upon notice of COBRA eligibility by the department, it is the responsibility of the spouse or other eligible family member(s) to pay monthly premiums directly to the carrier(s) in the manner prescribed in the COBRA notice.

Vision Care Program,"1209. Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
The state does not continue paid vision coverage for employees into retirement. Each department is required to offer retiring employees the option to enroll in the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) Program. COBRA allows employees and dependents the option to maintain vision benefits for either 18 or 36 months after losing coverage because of certain COBRA qualifying events.

Departments are responsible for ensuring that covered employees and their covered dependents are provided with COBRA information, required COBRA notices, and for assisting those employees and dependents that elect to enroll by ensuring all forms are completed and submitted timely.

Departments should review the COBRA policy and procedures outlined in the Benefits Administration Manual (BAM) – COBRA Section 400 in the event an employee or dependent has any of the following COBRA qualifying events:

COBRA Qualifying Events and Length of Eligibility
Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than for Gross Misconduct), Reduction of Hours: 18 months
Death of Employee, Divorce, Termination of Domestic Partnership, Legal Separation, Employee’s Entitlement to Medicare, or Dependent Child Ceases to be a Dependent: 36 Months
Military call-up: 24 Months
For a leave of absence, the vision benefits may be continued through Direct Payment, not COBRA. (see Section 1207 for direct payment information)",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-administration-manual/vision-care-program/,Vision Care Program

The bargaining unit contracts specify that family member eligibility for dental benefits shall be the same as that prescribed for health benefits.

The DRV began in 2018. The eligibility of family members is re-verified once every three years. The re-verification period is based on the employee’s birth month.  Government Code 19815.9 also requires the employing office to:

Verify the eligibility of all dependents prior to enrolling them in health, dental and vision benefits
Retain and maintain a record of the verifying documentation for each dependent in the employee’s official personnel file
Validate/re-verify dependent eligibility at least once every three years for most dependents
Remove unverified dependents from benefits coverage

When should a department submit an Employer's First Report of Injury (STATES 3067S)?,The department should submit the Employer's First Report of Injury as soon as possible after the employer’s knowledge or notification that a work-related injury or illness has occurred and no later than five days from the employer’s date of knowledge.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
How do I determine the date of knowledge (DOK)?,"The date of knowledge (DOK) is the date the employer knew or should have known that a work-related injury or illness occurred or is being claimed.

For example:

• A work-related injury or illness has occurred that requires medical treatment beyond first aid or that results in lost time beyond the date of injury.
• An employee informs you that he or she has suffered a work-related injury or illness. The claimed injury or illness does not have to be witnessed.
• An employee presents a doctor’s note stating that a work-related injury or illness has occurred.
• An accident occurs on state property injuring a state employee.
• An accident occurs while a state employee is conducting state business and the employee is injured.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Are employees eligible for Administrative Time Off (ATO) for appointments or other lost time related to their workers’ compensation claim?,"When in the course of a workers’ compensation claim, an employee is asked to attend a medical-legal evaluation pursuant to Labor Code 4060, 4061 or 4062 with a medical evaluator, such as a Qualified Medical Evaluator (QME), an Agreed Medical Evaluator (AME), or an Independent Medical Evaluator (IME), the employee should be placed on Administrative Time Off (ATO) for any time lost from work.

In addition to medical-legal appointments, ATO is also granted for time lost on the date of injury and for time lost to attend a deposition.

ATO is not granted for regular medical appointments, to meet with attorney, or to attend a hearing or other appointment at the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.

For more information on ATO related to a Workers' Compensation claim, please refer to the CalHR Manual: Workers’ Compensation Administrative Time Off.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Are departments still required to report COVID-19 cases?,All COVID-19 cases should be reported to State Compensation Insurance Fund through the end of 2023.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
How does our department add or remove employees from the CalHR Workers’ Compensation contact list in order to receive information about the Forums and Roundtables meetings?,Email all CalHR Workers’ Compensation contact list changes or requests directly to workcomp@calhr.ca.gov.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
What is the first day of disability for IDL for the purpose of calculating the 52 weeks or appropriate work hours in the two year period for IDL?,"The first day of disability is the first day of lost time, not the date of injury. Since the day of injury is paid as Administrative Time Off, it would not be appropriate to include the date of injury as the beginning of the IDL period. It is important to remember that all days of disability must be confirmed by State Fund and may be partial days of disability.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
 Is time used on the date of injury picked up as Administrative Time Off only after the workers’ compensation claim is approved?,"No. If the employee missed time from work on the date of injury, this time is Administrative Time Off even if the claim is not approved for workers’ compensation benefits. Employees should be directed to seek appropriate medical treatment, and employers should authorize the initial visit and secure transportation if necessary.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Is IDL paid for time lost from work to attend medical appointments related to the employee’s workers’ compensation injury?,"No, not after July 1, 2014. IDL is paid for medically substantiated periods of disability that State Fund has confirmed. The obligation to pay IDL ends when the injured employee returns to work, is deemed able to return to work, or when the employee’s medical condition achieves permanent and stationary status. If the employee is able to work, time off solely to attend a medical appointment does not constitute a period of disability. Employees can use available leave credits, or adjust their time (depending on business needs) to attend medical appointments.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"How is the three calendar day waiting period calculated after July 1, 2014?","IDL is not paid for the first three days after an employee leaves work as a result of the injury unless temporary disability continues for more than 14 days, the injury is the result of a criminal act of violence, or the employee is hospitalized for treatment required by the injury. The three day waiting period shall be identified by State Fund as the first three days of medically substantiated disability. These days of disability do not need to be full days, consecutive days, or days that the employee was scheduled to work. The waiting period is calculated the same for all employees regardless of work schedules and time bases. Here are two examples:Emily Employee was injured on Thursday. The doctor reported, and State Fund confirmed, that Emily was disabled and could not return to work until Monday. The waiting period was served (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). Emily Employee was injured on Thursday. The doctor reported, and State Fund confirmed, that Emily could only work half time Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and return to work on her regular schedule on Monday. The employee has served the waiting period (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
" Prior to July 1, 2014, how was the three calendar day waiting period and 14 day period calculated?",The waiting period did not need to be consecutive or full days of absence. Partial days of absence relating to the disability (including medical appointments) were accumulated to 24 hours to fulfill the waiting period. The waiting period did not need to be consecutive or full days of absence. Partial days of absence relating to the disability (including medical appointments) were accumulated to 24 hours to fulfill the waiting period.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Must the Agency complete the Industrial Disability Leave – Benefit Option Comparison (STD. 618S) for every employee who is approved for IDL?,Yes. The STD. 618S must be completed upon receipt of the disability notification from State Fund. The STD. 618S is a key piece of documentation for both the employer and the employee that provides a basic explanation of the benefits and calculation of compensation.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"If an employee incurred a work-related injury or illness at one state agency and transfers to another agency, which agency is responsible for paying IDL?","Each agency is responsible for paying IDL during the periods of disability that occurred while the employee was working for that agency. The agency losing the employee has a duty to provide any history of IDL paid (calendar, 618S, etc.) to the agency gaining the employee.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Whose responsibility is it to track the waiting period and the 52 weeks or appropriate hours of IDL?,"It is the agency’s responsibility to track the waiting period and the hours of IDL. The agency should notify State Fund 30 days prior to the final hour of IDL, so that State Fund can begin paying TD, if appropriate. It is State Fund’s responsibility to notify agencies of medically substantiated periods of disability, including the waiting period. After July 1, 2014, full-time employees have 2080 hours of IDL available. To determine the eligible hours of IDL, for other time bases, use the following formula: 2080 x time base = total hours available The calculations for some common time bases are shown below:
1/2 time employees: 2080 x 1/2 = 1040 hours 3/4 time employees: 2080 x 3/4 = 1560 hours 5/6 time employees: 2080 x 5/6 = 1733 hours 4/5 time employees: 2080 x 4/5 = 1664 hours 7/8 time employees: 2080 x 7/8 = 1820 hours
",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
How are the appropriate hours of IDL tracked for employees who change time bases during the time they are receiving IDL benefits?,"The goal is to provide 52 weeks of IDL benefits within a two year period. If an employee changes time bases during their period of IDL eligibility, you will need to recalculate the available hours to insure the employee receives the benefits they are entitled to. Convert the hours the employee used to days (may need to approximate). Subtract that number from 260 paid days in a year to determine the number of available days of IDL. Convert the number of available days back to hours at the new time base. Here are two examples: Emily Employee was a full-time employee and used 360 hours of IDL, then her time base was reduced to ¾ time. How many hours of IDL are available?  360 hours at full-time = 45 days (360 divided by 8 hours/day)
260 – 45 = 215 x 6 (3/4 time = 6 hours per day) = 1290 hours of IDL available
Emily Employee was a half time employee and used 175 hours of IDL, then her time base was increased to 7/8 time. How many hours of IDL are available?
175 hours at 1/2 time = 44 days (175 divided by 4 hours/day = 43.75 round
to 44)
260 – 44 = 216 x 7 (7/8 time = 7 hours per day) = 1512 hours of IDL available
",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Should employees on alternate work week schedules have their schedules changed to a 5-8-40 schedule?,No. An employee off for the month on IDL can remain on their alternate work schedule and does not earn or use excess hours or holidays. An employee cannot be paid more than the maximum hours in the pay period.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
How are excess/deficit hours shown for employees on alternate work week schedules who are using IDL intermittently or working while on IDL?,Treat the employee the same as if they were working. The employee receives a credit for months when there is an excess and for months with a deficit they must use leave credits to supplement the number of hours required for the pay period.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Does the amount of leave credits used to supplement IDL count toward the hours of IDL the employee is entitled to?,"No. Leave credits used for supplementation have a dollar value, but no “time value.” The employee’s time off is already covered by IDL, the supplementation is just a cash out of available leave credits to bridge the gap between the IDL payment and regular salary.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
 Can an employee receiving IDL go on vacation?,"Yes. If the employee is totally temporarily disabled and receiving full IDL, continue the IDL payment. If the employee is working while on IDL, continue the IDL payment and post appropriate leave credits for the additional time missed from work. Agencies are encouraged to share information about the employee’s activities with the claims adjuster.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Are employees entitled to special pay(s) when they are on IDL?,"Refer to Section 14, “Pay Differentials”, in the California State Civil Service Pay Scales Manual to determine if the special pay should be included or excluded from the IDL calculation. If it states that the pay should be included in the calculations and is ongoing, the IDL calculation must include the special pay. If the special pay is task related (e.g., diving pay) and the employee must perform the task to receive the pay, the special pay should only be included if the employee was scheduled to perform the task.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Is an employee entitled to shift differential while on IDL?,"Yes, if the employee was receiving the shift differential at the time of the injury. However, if there is a regular shift rotation that would place the employee on a shift not entitled to the differential, payments for IDL and supplementation should be recalculated to exclude shift pay.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
How is an employee compensated for holidays while receiving IDL?,"If the holiday falls within the disability period it is compensated in the employee’s IDL payment.  If the holiday falls outside the disability period or is a Saturday Holiday, provide payment or holiday credit as if the employee were not receiving IDL. If the employee is working reduced hours due to the injury, and receiving IDL for the balance of the hours, the employee would be paid for the holiday and the time would not count against the employee’s IDL benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee who is in two state miscellaneous positions qualify for IDL in both positions?,"Yes. If both positions are CalPERS/CalSTRS-qualifying positions, the employee may receive IDL if he or she is disabled in both jobs, as long as the total IDL compensation does not exceed the equivalent of one full-time position. The position with the higher time base is used for this calculation; if both positions are equal in time base, the higher salaried position is used. If the employee is in a full-time position and a part-time position, IDL is paid on the full-time position.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee who is in two state safety positions qualify for EIDL in both positions?,"Yes. If both jobs qualify for EIDL, the employee is disabled from both jobs, State Fund has notified both agencies, and the appointing powers at both jobs approve the benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
 Does an employee continue to make CalPERS/CalSTRS contributions and earn full retirement credit while receiving IDL?,"Yes. An employee’s full CalPERS/CalSTRS contribution will be deducted from the IDL payment. The employee will continue to earn full retirement credits. For more information regarding retirement contributions, contact CalPERS or CalSTRS directly.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Does an employee continue to make CalPERS/CalSTRS contributions and earn full retirement credit while receiving IDL?,"Yes, however per Government Code section 19844.1, time when an employee is excused from work because of holidays, sick leave, vacation, annual leave, compensating time off, or any other leave shall not be considered as time worked by the employee for the purpose of computing cash or compensating time off for overtime. Only actual hours worked count toward the weekly calculation for premium rate overtime pay. Employees who are not eligible for premium rate would earn straight rate pay.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can employees supplement Permanent Disability (PD) advances with leave credits?,No. There is no statutory authority to supplement PD advances with leave credits.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee opt to use their sick leave in lieu of IDL?,"No. Government Code section 19871 states that the employee shall receive IDL. However, employees are allowed to use leave credits or dock to cover periods of disability that have not yet been confirmed by State Fund. Once the period of disability has been confirmed by State Fund, the agency will restore those leave credits and pay IDL.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"If an employee is injured prior to becoming a CalPERS or CalSTRS member and becomes a member while on TD, can he or she elect to go on IDL?",No. The employee must remain on TD for the duration of the disability because they were not eligible for IDL on the date of injury.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee receive IDL after reaching maximum medical improvement or becoming permanent and stationary?,"When an employee becomes permanent and stationary, they are no longer eligible for IDL. However, in some cases, an employee will experience a subsequent period of temporary disability. This would entitle the employee to an additional period of IDL if State Fund confirms the subsequent period of temporary disability and the employee has not exhausted their IDL benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"s it possible for an employee to receive IDL and NDI on the same date, assuming that they qualify for both benefits?","Yes. If the NDI benefit is greater than the IDL benefit that the employee is due for the day, the employee gets the IDL and the balance due for NDI. For example, if the IDL benefit is $10 and the NDI benefit is $19, the employee receives $10 in IDL benefits and $9 in NDI benefits. Refer to Government Code section 19882 This is uncommon and rarely happens during IDL",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee receive State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits for an industrial injury?,"Employees can apply for and receive SDI during the period of disability while their workers’ compensation claim is pending or denied. If the claim is approved at a later date, and IDL benefits are confirmed by State Fund, there may be over lapping IDL and SDI benefits, and a potential overpayment of SDI. The employee is responsible for resolving any SDI overpayment with the Employment Development Department.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Can an employee take a bereavement leave while on IDL?,Yes. The employee is entitled to bereavement leave when on IDL. The agency should interrupt IDL and put the employee on bereavement leave (regular pay status) for the appropriate period of time and then resume IDL. The regular pay days/hours do not count toward the IDL limit.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
 Can an employee attend jury duty while on IDL?,"Yes, if the work restrictions placed on the employee do not conflict with jury service. The employee is bound by the same rules regarding jury duty as if they were working, and should provide substantiation of jury service. The agency should interrupt IDL for the period of time the employee is on jury duty and place them on regular pay status. Once jury duty is completed, the employee should be placed back on IDL. The regular pay days/hours do not count toward the IDL limit.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
Is an employee eligible for catastrophic leave while waiting for IDL to be approved or for supplementation of IDL?,Yes. An employee may be eligible for an agency’s catastrophic leave program if the nature of the illness or injury otherwise meets the criteria established by the agency for catastrophic leave. Please check the appropriate bargaining unit contract.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"If an employee is off work on IDL and is eligible for a Merit Salary Adjustment (MSA), should the supervisor approve the pay increase?",Yes.

Marital status and dependents may be changed after the first 22 working days or 176 hours of IDL have been paid.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-hr-professionals/benefits-program-information/workers-compensation/,Workers’ Compensation Q&A
"Can an employee on IDL who subsequently demotes during the disability period retain their salary rate, or is the salary rate adjusted to reflect the demotion?","IDL should be adjusted to reflect the salary an employee would receive if the disability had not occurred.
